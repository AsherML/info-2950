Somethin' up, Tommy His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick. Before the war, the City of the Angels was graced with two local fighters, born and raised a scant five miles apart, pugilists with styles as different as fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each other, but a sense of duty brought them together in spirit, and both joined the Los Angeles Police Department. Blanchard cracked the baffling BoulevardCitizens bank robbery case in 1939 and captured thrillkiller Tomas Dos Santos Bleichert served with distinction during the '43 Zoot Suit Wars Both men made great sacrifices to serve their city, and on Election Day, voters are going to be asked to do the same thingvote on a five million dollar bond proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment and provide for an eight percent pay raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote Yes on Proposition B. Subtle. I'm in. Uh, yes sir. Hello. I always won. You a fight fan I'll try not to hurt you.

Your fault for buying her all those chemistry classes. No. Thanks. You send me back to Warrants Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched. All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial. And a grandstanding son of a bitch. What are you gonna do Oh Jesus. She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least three misdemeanors here. It's out of control I promised him a week on it. Four more days and it's over. Slumming, Miss Sprague I'm a policeman. Homicide. Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

Ever get any movie work So what about the film can A dirty movie Was this around Thanksgiving Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder Did he seem particularly interested in Betty Did she see him again But you saw him again, didn't you How else could you have gotten a copy I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day. Yeah. I did, partner. I did. Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short Yes, sir. It's me. You want to get together I'll pick you up in fortyfive minutes. I have an apartment, you know. No. And I checked through the case file. There's no mention of that noteleaving number you pulled. beat Babe, I'm withholding evidence for you. It's a fair trade for what I'm getting, but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven't told me about Betty and Linda Jesus Christ. Blanchard! Not good enough. Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee He's in trouble, you know. De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over to stay with you. Kay. Lee Short of winning Thank you very much.

Whattya know about the husband Wonder how he made it Oh really I'm...looking for the hammer. Were you ever going to tell me Were you ever going to tell me Ever. Were you ever... Who was the driver, Kay Tell me. Tell me! You're not that old. And you're not very widowed. You seem to be doing all right. Little over a year. So how well do you know the Spragues Your husband sounds like a good man. I read an article in the paper. Maybe your husband It's not so strange. I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue. I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine Jane. Don't be catty. God that is spooky. No thanks. And you mine. It's me. Nothing. I thought the family came back from Laguna this week. Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories Hey! Goddammit! Get back here! Babe Babe. Goddammit. Wait You didn't move far. Tighter'n a popcorn fart. I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said... My father. She killed herself a long time ago. Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's just... I want to search every fucking inch of every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague property if it takes the rest of my shitty career. And I know exactly where we start. Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that lantern. Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's another set of latents up there on the doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad I can't transfer 'em. We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of her. All right here. No. Thanks. I'll stay here. I want to get up early and confirm these prints. That night I pictured myself the way I wanted Elizabeth to picture meher knight in shining armor, a reborn twobit harness bull who cracked the biggest unsolved homicide in California history. A war hero, a heavyweight champion. I stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at all. Because there was no way for me to make the arrest without admitting that I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The case would always be open. And so while it killed me to wait 'til morning, in some ways...this was our last night together. And what is that, Emmett Saps like me Direct line to the straight dope Or is that what you needed George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and the two of you covered it up. You helped Linda Martin and Betty make that stag film. Where was the set In one of Daddy's old buildings Of course. She looked like his daughter. He fucked your wife. But I don't think you cared about that. But he's her daddy. And that must have made you crazy. He was a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't think he was disfigured in a car wreck. How'd it all go down So many pretty things here... He was a sick fuck and you knew it! What did you tell Betty What did you tell her Then Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake. And then what I come along Daddy tell you to fuck me or was that your idea The whole family have a good laugh at dinner that night Pumping me for info about the case Throwing me Georgie stories to see if I'd bite A little hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't check out your alibi What about sweet little Martha Martha tell you this Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's. Passports. All four. I need to see it. Just to be sure. I need to see it. I need to see his grave, you tightass kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you bury George Tilden Yeah, well. Old habits die hard. Yes, I'm fine. Where'd Eldridge get the painting I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you. So tell me. Let me see. Tell me about Betty Short. Your husband bought her for George. For George You tortured her. She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat. How much of the hundred grand did Lee let you keep He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew about Laverne's Hideaway. He blackmailed Sprague And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He took that hundred thousand and split to Mexico and you let him go! He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business with the lady. I've been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. But I haven't had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya think Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short to the very end, eh It's not as good as yours, I'll admit. But then again you've got an ear for accents. Accents, dressing up in costumes... Do another one for me. Play someone else. Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do another. How 'bout the Mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let's see the makeup job. Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased after poor daddy's money. Tell me somethingyou shoot Lee yourself Did you at least have the guts to shoot him yourself",3126

6,ELLIS LOEW,The Black Dahlia,0,False," Prop. B's looking like a loser right now. But if we can drum up some publicity we may he able to get it passed in the '47 Special. We need to build up morale in the department. Impress voters with the quality of our men. Wholesome white boxers are a big draw, Bleichert. You know that. Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central Warrants You shouldn't have slugged with him. You were ahead on all three cards. Yes but some of your patron's lost money. Play things smarter here. Don't blow this like you blew the fight. Here's the man to fear. Witnesses made him at a stickup near Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol whipped an old lady. She died about an hour ago. Negro girls. Young ones. All the complainants have been colored. Sergeant Blanchard Try not to kill the man. I'd like to do it in court. ...and the heinous nature of this killing makes it imperative to catch this fiend as soon as possible. A number of specially trained officers, including Mr. Fire and his partner Mr. Ice... Captain have you sent men to talk to the victim's father How about Vogel and Koenig Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants. You're my man, and you made me look like a fool in front of the two most powerful men in the Department. If you weren't Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty already. You've gotten personally involved in the Short case Shut up, Bleichert. You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow. Report to me at 0800 with letters of apology for Green and Horrall. For the sake of your pension I'd suggest you grovel. Blanchard! You've been skating around all morning, Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to check out a radio car and get out there. And if you see that phantom partner of yours, tell him this noshow's gonna cost him three days pay. We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney he made the pic Bleichert. Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended. I called this little meeting for a couple reasons, Bucky. We'd both like to see the Short case closed out and get back to normal business. We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants you for his partner when he gets his lieutenancy, and Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There are four confessors still being held at City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't coherent when they were first questioned, and they're all violent, frothingatthe mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated. It's a muscle job. But Bill's a bit too enamored with violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no Because if it's yes, I'll make sure you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some stripes. If not, it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard gets tired of you. We both know that Russ is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight. That could be a long time. Yes or no Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks from now. Right before the election. All the gate to charity. After that, we bring back the interdivisional boxing team. Wholesome fighters. I'm betting on great things from you, Bleichert. And if I don't miss my bet we may be colleagues soon. I'd say my prose fits the crime, Lieutenant.",551
7,FAY,The Black Dahlia,0,False," I saw you fight a couple times. You won. Fairy tale come true, isn't it The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy tale. You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know you won't believe me. But you've more than repaid him already.",44
8,KAY,The Black Dahlia,0,False," Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme art classes so I'd sketch the boxers. For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets ridiculed for perpetrating this farce. For financial reasons I hope Lee wins. And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both look good with your shirts off. Luck, Dwight. At least he looks good with his shirt off. I was never very good. Ended up with a degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight money paid for it. I asked him to. Besides, catching animals gave him a sense of order. You have a girlfriend, Dwight We're not getting married if that's what you're wondering. I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow night. Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight. Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it. Then you've never really had to. Lucky man. beat Lee! Dinner! To fairy tales! Oh baby. Oh babe. Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight. We're on edge. He swore at the trial he was going to kill Lee. Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby. Hi, Dwight. Lee stomps, you tread lightly. Let me guess...Lee's up all night probably on Benzedrine againworking that poor girl's murder You're worried about him. And he's worried about me. But who's worried about you Is that left for me For such a cautious man you're quite a hardcase. Good night. Hi, Dwight. Lee, Dwight's here. This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but I'll give you a theory if you'll eat something to calm yourself down. Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were two killers. Because the torture cuts are crude, while the bisection and the cut on the abdomen are neat and clean... It's sick and it's insane! After everything...And all that might happen Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes. We're famous, Dwight. I haven't seen him since you beat him up. I don't blame you. I don't want you coming over here just to sleep an the couch again. You know Dwight Fighting, cops, guns. To most peoplethat's the scary stuff. Not everything else. Luck. Luck. I spent the morning with Internal Affairs. I told them...everything I knew. I gave them so much...and in the end it didn't seem like anything at all. You don't know anything, Dwight. But that's what I like about you. I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone now I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San Francisco... When You're a fool, Dwight. That reminds me of something, Dwight. Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it Sounds lovely. Where is it What're you doing Dwight Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it. He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel. He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to his friends... ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job. He and Lee, they never even met. After Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured framing Bobby'd give me a way out... Then last year...the fourth manthe driverhe heard Bobby was getting paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt that Lee framed him. He wanted money we didn't have. Ten thousand dollars. Promise me this Forgive him for DeWitt. Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't matter anymore. Not to us. Baxter Fitch. He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him everything else. But don't forgive him for that. Ever. Dwight Dwight I didn't touch your things. You can have the furniture. Did you think I'd let my husband disappear for three weeks and do nothing about it I've had detectives following you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like that fucking dead girl, so you can have hernot me. Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile. Dwight You are so, so good at some things. He was going to leave no matter what. I didn't know if I was ever going to see him again, and I wanted him to be comfortable if such a thing was possible. Dwight, he knew I was in love with you, and he wanted us to be together. Goddammit, Dwight! That girlthat girl! I don't give a damn about that girl. She ruined our lives! He loved us. Don't take that away from him. And I love you.

We weren't that close anymore...You married God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there Sorry. Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They served on the California real estate board together. But Emmett was a bit of a crook. My husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations. He had his moments. Most of it was out of guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro. When he learned he had cancer, he really started feeling guilty. He voted Democratic last year. Even went in and had meetings with the City Council. I'm sure he gave them dirt on Emmett. Same day Eldridge killed himself. Apropos, I guess. My husband was rich and did a mean Charleston. I loved him until I found out he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting to love him again. How strange. You're very accepting of other people's frailties. You're young. You should have illusions. So how'd a cop get mixed up with Madeleine Sprague It was Madeleine, I assume Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a roundheels. Always has been. I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure. She probably inherited it from her mother. You figure out the rest, officer. Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my birthday a couple years ago. I hate it. Want to take it with you Thank you, then. You were my best condoler. ...and then Eldridge said I'm sure that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not my dog and those sure as hell aren't my shoes! It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of course you've been staking out the Sprague house. Four nights in a row. I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost as nosy as you. I'd been thinking about giving it to charity, but it's too valuable. I found Eldridge's receipt... It's a Frederick Yannantuono original, inspired by an old classic novelThe Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo. The clown in the painting is the book's main character, Gwynplain.

Someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer. You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind.  This book must have been written at least six months, maybe years before it was published.  That means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then.  The fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism. Correct. You're dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book.

99,STYLES,Basic,2000,False," Jesus, God. . . That's enough, Lieutenant. Who's shooting at them That was one of their own, he just Shot one of their own men Get us on the ground! He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman . He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here. You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack. Then it's unofficial. Been better. I read about what's been happening With you... I should have called Would I have called you if it wasn't If there was any other way 6. This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, The closest thing we have to an in House investigator. The official term for it is Clusterfuck . By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one  a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant... A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to noncom to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country. The exercise was one of his Section Eight private sessions. Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning. No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup. Cadet Roberto R. Nunez.   Killed right in front of me. I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. On a transport leaving here at 1700 The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop. Tom, bottom line I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished Thank you. Osborne will brief you on the cadets. And Tom It really is good to see you. You think he did it You've got four hours and fortyfive minutes to find out. He can wait.     Kendall's out of surgery. Who killed Pike What do you think West's body isn't in the creek bed. We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing. Habeas Corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime. Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession. Nevertheless Not for me. 46. JAG gets here in three hours.   Try for the confession. Tom, where are you going What about the confession What the hell are you talking about Fucking asthma... This whole thing's driving it nuts. Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level Does Osborne agree You want Kendall, don't you You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore. I'm giving you a chance to walk away. You don't get to be a Colonel without compromising. Without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs. You politic, play it safe, think of the career first. And when things get dirty, you just look the other way... 69. Four of my men are dead. You think Kendall had something to do with it, then you go get the son of a bitch. It's over.   Time of death was 442. 80. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter. Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it. We found the cabin. Demolished, like they said. No bodies. Hurricane like that coulda scooped 'em up, dropped them down two counties over. We'll find them. You think you could explain all this to me Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out. The Senator... 81. Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world. I thought you said that wasn't a compliment. What in God's name is going on Hang on. No.   I want to hear this. 89. You're lying, son. Tom Tom, is that you What are you talking about You're drunk Look 100. Or what   You've gone round the bend That's preposterous Wanted to see if he was okay I'm not even going to dignify that You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you. You're crazy For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about You think you could explain all this to me The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup. The army kicked you out for drugs... There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you. Habeas Corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime.",933

Don't you mean don't need no liquor license not taken away from me Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going. Bill Styles... Old friend. Haven't talked to him in 911. Can I use your phone Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no. . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah... yeah, of course I'll come. An hour. I gotta go out to McKinley. 5. How are you What kind of trouble are you in That bad Tell me what I can do. And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules Fantastic.   You want to tell me what's going on It's not West, is it    Tell me it's not West. Ah, Christ He was our Drill here.    Man's older than sand. 7. Well, he's a good soldier. I didn't mean that as a compliment. And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore. And the problem is you only got three. I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me And I'm the closest thing to it, right I'm not gonna let that happen. Gotta be honest, I love what you've Done with the place He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him. It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne Three things. First  You don't have a choice. Second I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys. Levi   Who names their kid Levi Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone He's in interrogation Move him. 10. Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute Is Dunbar cute Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight  these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got. Something like that. Oh, and Osborne You have any donuts around here 11. Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom Hardy and I believe you've already met Officer Osborne. I understand you had a rough time of it last night Not talking, huh You probably just want to get some food and some sleep. They feed you yet Go on. You can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them my parents did it for years. Want another one 12. Maybe later. Ray, let me say this up front  I'm not a cop. I used to be, but that's beside the point. Who I am doesn't really matter what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble. You understand that, right Now, I don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly I don't really care. I'm just doing a favor for Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. To be honest with you, though, I don't care about that either. I don't know those guys, you do. They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news  tragic, but it doesn't affect me. The only thing I care about is I agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up. You like baseball I could talk baseball for   days. Batting averages, ERA's, I   got statistics in my brain, I   don't know how I remember them. It's    freaky. You wanna talk baseball Come on Ray, we're gonna be here five hours, we gotta talk about something. So who do you like 13. Why not You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty. What do you like then C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here. Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd 14. knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns I was also his  knife dummy . See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day. Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I'd ask where West and the others are. Can we get to them They're dead, aren't they You kill them See, Ray, this is what we call good cop, bad cop. 15. She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established. But I don't want to play games. That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors  everyone knows those things are two way, right Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay Believe somebody owes me ten dollars Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good Everyone knows good cop, bad cop  by admitting it I appeared trustworthy. Yes 16. Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like  nice guys Dunbar takes a deep breath. Tell me about them. That's not exactly true... I'm living proof. How did you get Sectioned, Ray 21. And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you You smoke, Ray No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some. My brand.   Must be my lucky day. 23. Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you M. P. Sirs He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him Why'd you join the army You're right. We should sit in silence. Best time for banal chitchat. Microrecorder for Kendall  didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck. You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib. I lost a bet. Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out. The very same. I plan to grow on you. So noted. You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here. He's telling the truth, up to a point. Being back here. Gives me the willies. No. It is. Got it. Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk. Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room.  I suggest you talk to us. But not the only victim, right It's too early in the day for me to give a shit about some pissant cadet's bad version of intrigue. You want to talk to us, send word over to the brig. Let's go. You're working too hard, Levi. I can tell cause you're sweating. And you're sweating cause you have no idea what Dunbar's already told us. Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight. I lied.   Wait for it... We're on our way. 28. Sergeant West is dead isn't he And the other three Cadets Feel free to elaborate . Senator Daddy must be thrilled. I think you just blew Don't Ask, Don't Tell out of the fucking water. More intrigue, Levi Levi, I don't know   if you're familiar with investigative   work, but we have this little thing   called motive and you just gave   yourself one. What happened to degrees 32. Then who did But you didn't. Because Childs is the one who shot you. He admitted it. Why did he come back for you Okay. I think that's it.     He rises and walks to the door. Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez. Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target. Too neat. How long have you been an investigator That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me  murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people  it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy. Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne. 45. Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have Tried harder to witness it for you There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it. Okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car From Dunbar I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty. Nevertheless what' Kendall will testify and that'll be enough. You mean not enough to save you. Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy. Kendall  seems you killed three people! That'd be my reaction too Well, why didn't you say so We'll Just drop all your charges, then Fuck you're serious, Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it. So Childs made some side money, so what People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you Yeah, we know, Pike did. I know enough to know you got two choices  you can sign a confession, in which case you'll probably spend the rest of your life in a military prison, or you can tell us to fuck off, in which case you'll probably get the gas chamber. Am I scratching your surface yet Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints 48. Home, I'm done. You want a confession Why don't you confess, Bill people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what He deserved it. There's your confession. Watch me. 49. West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him Sorry, no can do. I tried. Phenomenal at taking bribes, right Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my great second chance, Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here Why do you care I didn't shoot West... Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body. You saw West's body. And he'd been shot. Tell it to me. Stop. Kendall told us Mueller was the one who found them with West's body. What happened next     Dunbar shudders. You shot Childs and Nunez. You saved Kendall's life Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness. Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. 67. And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending. That bugs you too Let's go talk to Bill... What I said before 68. Yeah. Dunbar's confession. It should be enough to get you out of trouble. We know. You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot My heart weeps. Is it the truth Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life Dunbar was running out the door Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door. 71. Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said Dunbar was gone, My fault, I gotta check the tape on that. Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie. Well Dunbar will testify that you were. We're fucked, I know What Are you sure Something funny, Levi Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not That's a fantastic idea Why How do you know Little advice, Levi, next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves. Childs did it, huh First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs When are we getting to the others When are we gonna hear about Nunez Or Dunbar Or you, Levi When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies! You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them! Where are they! MAYBE WHAT 78. Shit! I pushed him too hard. Yeah, I could've.      Should've. No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy. Yeah. That's horseshit and you know it. I wouldn't know where to start. I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings. They're taking your command, aren't they I'm sorry, Bill. You're a good soldier, Bill. This time it is. Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. Nah. It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. 82. Plus, I got kicked out. That's gonna stay my secret. Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I Good, just making sure. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, Sergeant, but he didn't make it. 83. Why not What runway's that transport leaving from Get in. 84. We're not finished yet James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN! Right back where we started. No more games, right, Pike    It was you who West singled out... You who got hooked by Mueller's morphine... You who did it all. You wanted revenge on West, revenge on them all, so you killed them. But that wasn't enough. You needed a new identity, because no one was going to believe James Randall Pike, convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger  you needed a name people could trust, one that hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't publicly been West's bitch boy. 86. You walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable discharge  a guy who did everything he could to save his friends. We don't need the tapes We've found all of them. 87. Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun Isn't this how your story goes Pike annoys someone so much he gets shot in the head We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you WHERE'S WEST'S BODY Do what What did you do Goddammit, what did you DO! And the bodies No death certificates.    No crime. Not even close. Seven. Seven guys. What was it you said You were just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said. Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's question. How many Seven. This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine. Tough. Thing about    taking money is, you don't have    to do anything.  You just sit there.     Maybe you don't return a phone call.     Maybe you don't follow up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the money, your    work's done. Seven unsolved murders. And you know what It didn't weigh on my conscience. Not one goddamn bit. There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees. 98. Really. I may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me. West Do I have a choice in this Fuck it.   Let's go finish this. You have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs. That was good. It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you. I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this. Stay where you are. West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done. What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too. Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital you're the only other person who visited Kendall. You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike. No!  You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill  You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it 101. Not for long. No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough. You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen. Get your hands away from the desk! Osborne, gun! 102. Now it's over. Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do Think it'll work Want company I should probably write that down. In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you. Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks. I'll see you. You saved my life tonight. Keep it. Actually, don't keep it, I need the money. You're one of the good ones, Osborne. Don't sweat the details. Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray How about this Stem to sternum. You taught me well, Sarge. I wouldn't know where to start. 106. I guess it was about one man framing another... When you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy.. . And for that to work, you have to have a witness... Someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned... You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe... 107. And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the world. My brand.   Must be my lucky day. We got the toxicology report . . . Next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves... But it will not be in vain. Sometimes, you can trick the enemy into doing your work for you. . . He still carry those guns What I can't understand is why you signed these... I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are... He's telling the truth up to a point... You can't prove anything until we find the bodies... WHERE ARE THEY Murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings. Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.",3940

You can get us some answers. Hostile and uncooperative. You knew Sergeant West Sergeant West's served for twenty Three years. He's the public face of the modern Army. Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time... 8. You and the Colonel go back. You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres. 9. Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this. Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall Kendall Junior is still  in surgery, so he won't be available  to answer for his name or anything  else for another hour  the cadet  we're talking to first is Dunbar. Yes. Why Excuse me That is the most unprofessional Good copbad cop I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you. HARDY, Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes. Go. The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer Baseball You made me look like an idiot No Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out. Epilepsy. You really want to make banal chit Chat like that now We're in the middle of a murder case What is that 24. Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up. Something like that.     You You're kidding. I bet    that's the second story you tell    the girls to get them into bed, after    you make them laugh with the first    one. This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right 25. You're off to a late start. Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar What point Something wrong Not the happiest of memories Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. We just want That was kid gloves But we have to question him Thought you didn't have cigarettes He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own. He said what No one else heard it Why Why would he just surrender Nunez was chasing Dunbar. But you didn't see it, right It's too neat. I don't think that has anything to do with I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder. Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies  he didn't see any crime committed. He said he worked there What business 47. Hardy! I don't know. Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal I was starting to believe you, you know That you weren't who everyone Said. I guess I was wrong But you will. Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy. 50. Two and a half hours. That's all I'm asking. Two and a half hours to maybe get the truth. Silence. What Where What about the phosphorous grenade Back up. Mueller was alone in the cabin 52. At least you and Kendall agree on that. Yeah... yeah, sure. Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place 66. Where's the cabin Talk it through Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it Kill West, pin it on Pike. Dunbar. They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. So it's a good plan but it goes wrong Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story Buttfucks the cabin So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber Little bit. Yes, sir, I do. He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved. We know. Pike never confessed. Fifty minutes. Pike never confessed. Dunbar says you were. I need to talk to you outside. They got their stories straight. What Kendall said  the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around. That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter. Positive.    Hardy, they planned this. Not bad for hostile and uncooperative, eh Good idea. 73. You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're Going to jail It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission It will and you know why 74. Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off! Enjoy your flight to Washington What. Wrong answer Who killed Sergeant West Who, Levi So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike. What happened with Nunez That's how you do good copbad cop. Get something between his teeth! He's an epileptic! He's a witness! He's trying to say something You couldn't have known You wanted to get the truth. You mean the falsely accused You wanted to break him. So did I. What happens to Dunbar now Your car's in the motor pool.     I'll walk you over. So what now Think it'll work You know, you never told me why you left the army. For what We were close to something with Kendall. No. We're going need a vehicle release. Yeah. No, no that was Cadet Dunbar So Four We need to talk to him We need to talk to him now. Let's go have a talk. Fuck off. 85. We got maybe three minutes till they break it down. You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too. We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself How do you know that Hardy, what are you doing Hardy, for Chrissakes You mean the exercise No bodies, no West... We need to talk What 97. This isn't the time What if I don't want it That's not true. You're a good man, Hardy. Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past. And because you're a good man, I know you'll do the right thing. Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody took him off the plane before it left. My guess is he's already dead. Nobody saw.    But I don't think so. These are the requisitions from the PX, the ones used to release the drugs to Mueller. West signed half of them  Pike was telling the truth. Look who signed the other half. Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself. 99. It's West's, isn't it What are you doing out here Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. Nah. A word of advice about women  that first hour or so after they kill their boss Probably not the best time to hit on them. Yeah. . Your phone number 103. He was your friend. Hey, Hardy! I owe you this. They got their stories straight. . . They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. You never told me why you got kicked out of... Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.",1563
106,DUNBAR,Basic,2000,False," I don't like baseball. I asked for a policeman. It's... too slow. I just don't like it. I don't know... I like the Army. You did Basic here There's no need... Yeah. Okay. I'm not telling you what happened. Some. First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge hated him from the beginning. Sir, Dunbar, sir! Sir, yes, sir! Sir, yes, sir! 19. Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not Pike. Time went on and the Sarge started singling people out. He'd zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit. Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in what he called Section Eight. Washout rejects, guys he said were , dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead. He separated us from the rest. We slept alone... 20. . . .ate alone.. . ...and trained long after the other guys got to turn in. Fellas lived in daily fear of being Sectioned and with good reason, too. They figured we were the boys who'd meet with a training accident . No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class. That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. There were six of us... Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. One of those his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun . He idolized West. And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog. He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him. But Childs did. Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near. Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. 22. He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice. Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but... He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week. This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more. He's right.    We don't have a choice. We finished the course and came here, Then heard an explosion Where's Pike What do you mean, alone He wouldn't kill anybody. . . I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him! Shut up. Let me see your grenades. We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one. Whose blood is that, Jay       West's. What do you mean, West's That son of a bitch. He's lying. I'm serious Did Kendall tell you about the PX No, did he tell you about it   About the business Childs ran Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain Didn't shoot West You think you know everything, don't you You haven't even scratched the surface. Apologize Of course The creek bed Yeah One went off, yeah, but it didn't Touch him I thought you knew this 51. Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do He's lying, then. We didn't see Mueller till we got to the cabin. West...he's dead. Yeah. So did we.   Why didn't you come I didn't buy it. But Mueller had all three of his grenades. Pike came back. Where have you been, Jay 53. Shut up. West's dead. Where have you been, Jay We just want to check your pack You know it's not like that 54. Tie him up. Yeah... You hated West more than any of us. You're the only one missing a grenade. If not you, then who Oh, come on That's exactly what he says about you. You hated West, Mueller loved him Bullshit. 56. Why You're lying Why... why didn't you tell me That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him. Full clip to the body His chest was hamburger They I... I don't know... This is a lot of information to be Getting... I have to think 60. No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s Don't do this Put it down! So you killed him You too 64. And then I killed the last of them. Can I have some coffee They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession. But not Pike's. Would you have believed me Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away. Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this  I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die. You wanna bet Sorry, detectives.     Time's up. You want to talk about baseball now Can't do that now, though, can you Is that what I did, now And of course, you can prove all of it. Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me Check your tapes. Oh, you don't What else do you have on me You haven't found any bodies yet, have you Ohhhh, I don't think so... Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives ... you have nothing. Jesus! Please, please don't You'll never find it 88. You'll never find it cause HE'S NOT DEAD! He He made me do it Hunting we had to hunt him There never was an exercise! Never targets, never teams, I don't even know if there's a creek bed out there I COULDN'T KILL HIM! You're right. I was the one he singled out. Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. When Mueller found me, I was gone. He gave me a little taste... What I didn't know, was his friend was West. He ran the whole thing. You think it's easy to have all that morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it Check the requisition orders, I'll lay money it's his signature on them. That was his game, see Ride the cadets so hard they'd need something to stay on their feet. Then he'd send Mueller or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away. It wasn't a new thing either.   He'd been doing this for years. 90. Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new potential customers. The amount of money involved over that period of time... this was some high stakes shit. Dunbar moved his through the kitchen. I worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics. By the time the hurricane hit, we were all in. Some using, some pushing, some both. But then something happened. West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow his whole operation. He figured he'd made enough money, had enough of the army, maybe it was time to disappear. But first he was gonna teach us one last thing. The Tuesday Night drill was the perfect cover. The hurricane made it even better. He put us on the chopper and flew us to his cabin. And then he told us. It was insanity. We were hunting a man down to kill him. He got Mueller first. 92. He took his gun. Used it on Childs. I can't imagine what it was like. Having your friends try to kill you... But you do what you have to survive. Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple minutes later. It came to me in a split second. Change clothes, change identities. If James Pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail. But if I was Dunbar, I could walk away from all this with a new life. But then... 93. I just want to go! I have to get Kendall to a hospital! We don't have to do this! You go that way, I'll go this way! You killed three people!    Isn't that enough for one night I don't want to die out here, Roberto! Do you 94. Forgive me. .. I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance. You know the rest. You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good. Just four people MIA.    Silence. I don't want any deals. 96. All the proof you need will be when West comes back and puts a bullet in my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a dead man, anyway. Like Kendall. We both should have died out there with our brothers. I know that now. Tell me, detective.   Did you get what you wanted Your weapons, Sergeant. 105. Washout rejects, guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead... You haven't found any bodies yet, have you... Are you ready for this Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying. Fuck you.",1683
107,WEST,Basic,2000,False," You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me  give me a sir, yes, sir! Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident Give me a sir, yes, sir! In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand Give me a sir, yes, sir! So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military  you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand! My power here is absolute, isn't that right, nigger I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that What the fuck is this You lay a hand on me while I'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you Get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up! What the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off! Get those fucking pants off, I want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army issue clothes! Cadet, what's your name! You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear The rest of you, fallout for physicals! Get up, get up, get up! We're going on a little night hike, boys  muster in five on the south tarmac! A rifle, a pistol, and three phosphorous grenades to a man! This is live fire, so keep those safetied until we touch down I don't want anyone shooting their dick off! Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather  they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two 31. and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows  Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs! I will be in the areas monitoring your progress and if I see anyone drag ass I will personally slit you stem to sternum and leave you for dead! Fall out! You're gonna die tonight, faggot. First team, second team, third team, go, go, go! What the fuck is going on! 59. Gentlemen! It has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst. Someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that I have endeavored to create in all of you. Perhaps that failure is mine. But we take care of our own. And this traitor must be made to pay. 91. Run. I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found the letter you'd written to the Colonel in your locker.  You were going to betray us all.  Now, run. Now we'll see whose training's paid off the most. You are to hunt Cadet Nunez down and bring his body back to me. If you fail and he escapes, we all go down together. Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You get the gold star. You'd best get him out of here. Don't worry about the bodies, they'll be taken care of. This is where we part ways, Cadet. You tell them I died out here, or I'll come back for you. Tell them one of the others did me. Mueller, Childs, I don't care who. You and Kendall, you tell them a story. You can tell a story, can't you 95. Dismissed. Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare is simple and complex. Simple in its goal, complex in its execution. 104. As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare is deception. At all times you must confuse your enemies, surrounding them with uncertainty, giving them false hope. At all times, you must mask your true intentions. What the fuck is going on Is this about that little drug business you all are running Yeah, I know about that, Roberto told me Fuck that. You little pissers really think you can throw a scare into me You're gonna have to do a lot better than that, son. Didn't I kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago Should've known you were involved in this. Come on then. Let's see you try and stick me Your greatest weapon will by your allies . . . . . . some of which you may have to sacrifice for the greater good. Make no mistake, the innocent will die. . . 108. ...if you engage in a clever enough subterfuge. Which brings us to the simple goal.

Any kindling for afire I mean I killed him. Isn't that what we all wanted Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec You hated West as much as I did. I'm not saying what I did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead. The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in Tomorrow and we're both fucked A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero. Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we both know   it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm   tied up, but we get the others to   go along Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead  the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! 42. We'll   move the bodies out to the creek   and say we came over the hill right   as they fragged West, all we gotta   do is tell the story right. What the fuck happened to you Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there Where's West What Oh, no. . . no, fuck that Roberto, what the fuck Why Blame the nigger, then, huh Someone turns up dead, you just look for the Darkest face in the crowd Do I Just like the first day, huh    You standing guard on me. This place ain't gonna hold much longer. You and me are friends, right Right You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray. 55. Maybe, but that don't make me a killer Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in Ray, this is my life    here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is gone, but you know I    couldn't have done this. It's not     in me. Mueller. We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away Who you gonna trust, Ray    Him or your friend Enough to go to prison Childs' PX Scam, Mueller was in on it Look in my pack. Just look.   Little pocket. Combat grade morphine.    Mueller sold it to me. . Pull up my sleeve.    Right arm. That look like a lie to you I been using solid for the last eight weeks. After that first night on the parade Grounds with you, I was bad Exposure, malnutrition, the works. I needed something to keep me from crashing. Mueller found me. He said he knew guy who had an in at the PX, could hook me up. This is before I knew what a dick he was. 57. Later on Childs got assigned there, started running the shit out to every cadet who needed it. But I was our class's first customer.. . Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know. You saw West, right   How was he killed From up close or far away That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing. And where's Mueller's When I came in, he was only wearing a tshirt. 58. Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first... Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper... Then Mueller ditches me during the exercise and heads for the creek. He blows the grenade to frame me and gets West to come running... . Childs' job is easy, he only has to delay Kendall long enough for Mueller to get away. Now all Mueller has to do is get rid of the evidence... And wait for everyone else to arrive. What don't you know There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West  my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now. Untie me. Untie me, Ray. Thank God. . . This place is going, Mueller.     We gotta move 61. Cause I didn't do it. Where's your shirt, Mueller Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of Here Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the Murder of Sergeant Nathan West You are to be stripped of all weapons And placed under guard Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body A test will no doubt link you to the Killing failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 63.

110,NURSE,Basic,2000,False," Normally we wouldn't let anyone see him this soon, but Colonel Styles said it was urgent 26. Cadet Kendall What is",22
111,KENDALL,Basic,2000,False," You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... You're not Army, are you That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here. My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me. 27. What, The Truth Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem. My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual. He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay. He wanted more than that. 29. Yes. It was the regular Tuesday night drill. He'd let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others. The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West. Maybe we shouldn't go. You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller We should tell him we're not going. You're gonna die tonight, faggot . Clear as day. He whispered it in my ear. You said you wanted to know what happened I'm telling you the truth. Didn't kill him I wanted to tell someone what he'd said, but I couldn't. Mueller would just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't care. Pike and Dunbar were okay, but... When West outed me, he isolated me. An outcast among outcasts. And I'd just been told tonight was the night I'd die. I knew Childs a little, we worked at the PX together. I started getting it in my head that maybe West had paid him, maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident 33. I'm I'm sorry. . . All I could think of was West, out there somewhere in the dark. Maybe watching the others, maybe watching me. And waiting to make his move. I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right. Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this was when they'd get me, when I felt safest. 34. But if I struck first and took out Childs, then maybe I could make it out alive... Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him. No.    Poetic justice, though. But that came later. What do we do Don't want to go What's Oh, Jesus.. . Did Did you How can you not know What about Pike There! 38. Poor fucker my ass... Yeah and he doesn't know when Oh, you remember now He was blown up by a phosphorous grenade, they don't exactly sell those at 711. Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed Them both, Mueller Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back. Pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up. So we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm. Because he had a plan. 41. Don't think I want to hear this You're sick, Pike. Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar. They had been close. I was in another room when it happened. I don't think he meant to do it. It was just reflex  he'd already been gutshot. I must have passed out cause next thing I knew... 43. And that's it. Because he'd shot Mueller. Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone. I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men. Mr. Hardy What did Dunbar tell you 44. Somebody emptied a full clip into him So you took off your shirt Mueller, what the fuck Pike, please Oh.. . my God... You framedhim... Okay 65. We've been making progress, I see. Running out of time, are we Tick Tock, ticktock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it How many murders did you cover up One Five Maybe an even ten. I think they're giving me the wrong medicine. This isn't a very good Hospital, you know 70. Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer. No, but it got you interested, didn't it Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong. There's that word again. As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting. Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning So I should stay silent about his misdeeds The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun No.   I said Dunbar. I believe your next line is What are you trying to hide Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury  they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs were quite the pair, the type of guys you didn't feel comfortable going to sleep around. Completely capable of murder. But as I said, I didn't hear the exchange before the shooting. I wasn't in the room. Then we'll leave it up to the courts His word against mine. What does his father do again Steelworker Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective. 72. I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you. You can't threaten me Didn't do anything What It won't work Wait Dunbar's telling the truth. We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone. It was because I threatened him. Because of what I saw. Who really killed West. Childs. 75. Because I was standing next to him. I was in on the PX thing. He and Mueller and me, we were making thousands. West found out. Childs said we were just gonna scare him Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. We met him in the creek bed but before I said anything... I swear, I didn't know he was gonna do it. After, he told me we were gonna pin it on Pike, one of our biggest customers. Nobody'd believe the word of a black junkie excon against ours. He told me I'd better keep quiet, or I'd end up the same as West. Dunbar didn't know anything about any of it. Everything he told you was true, except after... 76. I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished. I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to  see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret He came after us.

But   I also couldn't find a motive. Was   it spontaneous Was it planned Did   she know something someone wished she   didn't Was it about business And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't. She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated. So you know. Did you bring the last gift Henrik received I can tell you what their report will say now It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA. He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow. She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. As was I. They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still. I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case. Blomkvist isn't sure what that means. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one  taking out the files  uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. 78   EXT.

We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden. You know what our most profitable product now is Fertilizer. Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug. I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts  and the clock is ticking. I need your help. Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well  this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding.

He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman  which is what he did for the company  traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on. That's right.

That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there. Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else, including the young man from the bridge, his jacket draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.

Here's what I propose You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed or you don't. Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery. 26. 26. I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing  even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... HansErik Wennerstrom. He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate the carcass of the freshkilled and cooked duck they've been eating. It and the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed. He began his career working for me.

Knocks on a door, waits, listens to some deadbolts unlocking. It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back into the shadows of his dark apartment. The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. Indeed he was. That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak. Actually, Isabella  Harriet's mother who lives there she speaks to Harald  which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald. 32. 32. Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well  with my apologies. Out there is my nephew Martin's house Harriet's brother. It's a modern house  lots of glass  out on the point. I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger. Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a suspect. Vanger points off He lives over there. Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns. Sorry Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list. 66A   OMIT  INT. COTTAGE  DAY                                      66A 67    INT.

Are you sure Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this. You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. Erika nods politely. We're talking about an investment in the magazine. I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason. The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. Silence. So what do you say 59. 59. Erika halfshrugs to say she'll consider it. Is that a maybe She nods. Wonderful!   More wine, Anna.

I don't like bullies. I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission.

He was there that day Does anyone speak to anyone on this island Who doesn't he speak to I'm quickly losing track who's who. Who speaks to him I just met him. And you live here. Your house. For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means. Then he is, and is pleased by it. 33. 33. Business   She was sixteen. She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them. I have one. It's at the National Forensic Lab. I wanted to ask you about this. He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket. Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it delicately. The decades have dried out its pages. 37. 37. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ It's the last page I'm curious about. The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry. Was this also a missing girl case 38. 38. I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape. Is that what this is That one's good. That was a dark day. It's okay. There are worse things than libel  though I can't immediately think of one in my business. Henrik's biography. They are. I do. Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in hand and returns with it to the dining room. Maybe we could talk about that later. How so. You were here that day I know it well. 44. 44. It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company. It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. Unlike that one. Correct. I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus. Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age. 46. 46. I'd love to, where is she. You don't know where your own sister lives I'm getting used to that comment. People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point. I'll try to track her down for you. For myself then. He smiles.    She studies him.      Maybe he's not so bad. 47. 47. Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment. I'm Mikael.

To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life. Morell. I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end. Was he abusive Hers. 52. 52. She never confided in you what about, specifically What do you think happened to her But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who. No. 107   INT.

So I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade. I don't think so. Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything  especially after having to climb a flight of stairs. Maybe. Silence.   Then Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it. A119   EXT.

Thank you. He waits for her to leave.    She seems reluctant to ... You're too young to know about that. Hi.   What are you doing here What's in Skelleftea It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something. I didn't say that. As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it. I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it. It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry. Bye. The train begins to move. What What are you talking about What The train clears the platform. He watches after it.

He digs through Harriet's personal things for her Bible. Since all the number sequences begin with 3,' he goes to the third chapter  Leviticus  notices that its first facing page is faintly dogeared  finds R.J's verse 114  on it Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist. The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall. Nothing probably. As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to R.J. 30114 How was she killed Hang on a second. He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge. 74. 74.

But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this. I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case. And I apologize. We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him. I'm not so sure. Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently. I may have found something. The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings. Frode studies him again  wondering perhaps if Blomkvist suspects him. I need a research assistant.     Can you authorize that I can find one. The. I want to read it. Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of thing. It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do. You sure Let me give you a name then. He jots Annika Giannini on one of Armansky's PostIts. My sister. She's a lawyer. There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean. Silence.   Armansky tries not to look sick.    Then 78. 78. What does that have to do with anything. Mikael Blomkvist. Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting. She's not sure it's a harmless one. May I come in That's okay. 79. 79. He pushes the door enough to pass. Has a paper bag and satchel with him. Takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen. I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the coffee I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. He opens cabinets looking for the coffee.       She stares. We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend. 139   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT  LATER                             139 Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out. In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to. You're awake.    Good. Breakfast is ready. He pours her, and then himself, coffee. I guess I alarmed you showing up like this. That won't be necessary. He smiles. His eyes are not unkind.       As he helps himself to one of the bagels 80. 80. Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining. A copy of it sits next to his plate. When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader. Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer. I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food Lisbeth  may I call you Lisbeth I want you to help me catch a killer of women. 140   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT  LATER  DAY                  140 He's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches Salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the Vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, Xeroxes of the Leviticus list and verses. I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson. 81. 81. I have no idea who the others are or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl  but they have to be. His eyes settle on her blueblack handcuffs as hers settle on a copy of an old Hedestad Courier front page the article about the grisly murder of Rebecka Jacobsson. We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him. What are you doing Would you like this I'm home. He picks up the bowl of food he left on the porch, unlocks the door, goes inside, and sees the cat napping on his desk. He stares at it.

She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand. Excuse me. He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left. In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave. He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting. Can you read that Norsjo. Carpentry. Is that a phone number I'm going to have to go to Norsjo. He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs  sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika  lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood. He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing closeups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle.

One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before. It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement  but it looks like a gun. He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselbladtype camera. Looks at the man's face  then at his wall of Vanger family photos  unhappy to see it matches Harald ... 200    INT.

I was wondering if you could do that. You couldn't make an exception in my case. He gives her his most disarming smile. It usually works with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her. 111. 111. You won't help me Handsome. o.' Perhaps if you redecorated. The family. Pardon me No, it's  I can't tell who it is from this angle. He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son Martin Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party  it would be unusual if he hadn't  it's his sister that's missing but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist Hi.   How are you Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it. What. When. I fell in the dark. I just wasn't being careful. Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight. The knife block  with one missing is right there. Nothing new to report. Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a miniMaglite in the drawer. Maybe. 122. 122. Martin hands Blomkvist the miniMaglite. Thanks. 222   INT.

What did he say You said Henrik asked you to ask me something. What Oh. Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them. Sure. They drink.   Listen to a silence. 123. 123. No. Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence.        Then No. I suppose I am. My assistant.    Yes. Sorry It didn't work. I'm here. I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed. Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's easy manner in this dire circumstance. I found a picture no one had seen before. You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer. Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to participate. He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair. It squeaks again. That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when. It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate. A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site. 127. 127. Stockholm.   She went there this morning. You are a sick fuck. Your sister wasn't just another girl. Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes. You're choking me You killed her. Martin just stares at him confused.   Then He has more guns in the den Where is he How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state Since when have they said that. Something happened when you were twelve She doesn't say.    Just studies him ... It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything Oh. Silence.   Then Harriet Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry  at me  for not being able to tell him what happened to her. He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before. What if she did somehow get away Could she have done that Could she have done it alone He goes up to his wall of suspects. Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is. He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall. 239   INT.

When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you. Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ... She's my partner, Henrik.     She should stay. A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word partner.' I'm not sure. I can't.    I don't know.    I need a week. Vanger studies him.   Then I always liked this song.

He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car  the garage door come down  light go on inside the house  then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist just watches. Finally, to him It's me.   Sorry to bother you. She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either. No one's called you Your cousin. She has two, but doesn't ask which Martin. He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry. There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but I understand. That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know. Okay.   I think. He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen. She's playing solitaire And she still hasn't called anyone. Do we have her cell, too Salander points to one of the windows on the screen. His hand comes off her shoulder. 143. 143. I was so she'd lead us to her. I was just thinking.

He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue tattoo around his neck. Anita is taken aback by the sight. It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that. 144. 144. Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet. 250   EXT.

How are you feeling Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled. Yes, you are. Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that. Frode disagrees The court of public opinion, Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. 150. 150. Yeah ... Excuse me She had no idea he was doing it. That's what you would've done.     Not everyone's you. She's not sure she likes the comment. Decides she doesn't.   Takes her arm away from his shoulder. That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder. She doesn't.   So he drapes his on hers.    Then I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. Not a good day, that.

As Erika looks at it Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money  which accounts for all but 5percent of his holdings  ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire. This time you don't want to know. I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'. She isn't happy to hear that explanation. I could have gotten it from a source inside the company. But that's what you'll say. That depends on if you really want to know. He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate. We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to prison. Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement. Or maybe it is. In any case, she's not as enthused about all this as he is. What's wrong. What. I don't know that I have that much. Already. She nods.

The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal team, confidently addressing the reporters Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more.

How'd it go with Ms. Salander He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check. 86. 86. Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. I can't say I know how he thinks.    He might. Maybe Isabella. No one else. I'm calling this off. People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot. We get poachers. They're not always such great shots. Do you want to stop Why Blomkvist doesn't say.    Only I could but why on earth would I The private corporate records. How far back That's not what he meant. He's not well enough to ask. Excuse us a moment. Frode and Martin step away to confer in private. That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane. Over the course of 120 years of doing business Plenty. Hang on a second I'm going to let you decide.     It's Ms. Lindgren again. Where's Mikael I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night. What 136. 136. What do you know about this She doesn't say any more.   Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom I have to talk to Mikael What are we going to do I'm going to the police. The Salander points to a stack of video tapes. 137. 137. No. 236A   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM  LATER  MORNING                      236A Blomkvist halfwakes to find Salander lying next to him, fullyclothed, watching him. Is she actually there, or part of a dream He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice ... I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ... I don't think I'm seeing the point. paperwork It happened in the 1970's ... Salander watches the two men from across the room ... I swear I didn't know this was what Henrik had on him. If I had, I never would have let him bring you up here. But he wasn't trying to deceive you. A man's reputation used to mean something  he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion. Of course you're right ... I'm sorry. 262   EXT. VANGER MANOR  LATER  DAY                          262 Blomkvist and Salander sit out by the water, sharing the last cigarette in his pack. Her arm is draped over his shoulder, which strikes him as the most tender of gestures, coming from her.",1640

131,SALANDER,THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,0,False," Something wrong with the report There's nothing not in it. I'm not paid to give my opinion. He's clean.   In my opinion. He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset. That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character. That wasn't part of my assignment. And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either. The judgement will just about empty his savings. This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it. May I go Nothing that warranted inclusion. He's had a long sexual relationship with his coeditor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home. Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement. 9. 9. I know. No. I did. He likes sandwiches. A15   EXT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT  ESTABLISHING                A15 15    INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT  NIGHT                        15 Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika in their 20's  in which he's wearing a black leather jacket. She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it. His ward.   He doesn't have a daughter. Please. 21   INT. ICU  SODER HOSPITAL  LATER  NIGHT                   21 Did you make it I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now. I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian. It's unlikely he understands what she has said.        It's unlikely he even knows she's there. 68    INT. COTTAGE  NIGHT                                            68 Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist has written the names of the living Vanger family members and staff in the approximate locations of their houses. Next to it  3x5 cards and photos  a Vanger family tree which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards is the word, deceased.' He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy of a note when the call from Vanger came in Officer Morell informed by telephone of situation, 1019 p.m. 69    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND  NIGHT  1966                               69 Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.

VANGER MANOR  NIGHT  1966                                70 Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan sitting in the living room looking suitably worried. Make coffee and sort mail. Enough. I pay my rent. Never. It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances. I'm not a child. I've been on my own since I was twelve. Hard drives at home, yeah. It'll take five minutes.      It's important. Write down anything you want. Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again. For work. I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before. Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth Salander. ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment. I had a lot of work ... no, nothing to be concerned about ... I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight ... I don't need a pen, what's the address 53. 53. 97    EXTINT. HEDEBY ISLAND  TAXI  MOVING  DUSK                97 The taxi that first brought him here to the island, crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror. 98    EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING  NIGHT                    98 Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button. As she waits, she notes there's no security camera. It's me. The door buzzes.     She pushes it open. 99    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING  NIGHT                    99 She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread. Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe. It's nice. Food. He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin. I just want my money. Wait. She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair. Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to. I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat I can get home on my own. Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs. 61. 61. How much do one of those cost TELEVISION IMAGE A bland financial announcer reading the news. The graphic to the side of him is the distinctive V.I. logo of Vanger Industries. I need more money. I need to pay my rent. She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder. How did he ever get so lucky Me, too. Good.   You're alive. It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, faceup, wrists and ankles bound. He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged. She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints. Recognize this He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair. 68. 68. I had it with me last time. I set it here. Remember See this snap It's not a snap. It's a wideangle microlens. She takes a DVDR from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote. She got it all  what he did to her  the rape  in HD. This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then He starts to whimper. Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention. He can't. He can't even look at her. His life is over. He weeps into the gag. Look at me. He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot. He howls into the gag. Do I have your attention now She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus. 69. 69. If something happens to me  if I get hit by a car  if you hit me with a car  same thing, it uploads automatically. She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. Shows him that she has them. I'm taking these with me. I'll be checking on you. If I ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not His eyes dart to the TV as he nods that he understands. No.   Not the video. She kicks him. Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye. I will kill you. And he knows she means it. Do you doubt anything I've said Do you doubt what's in the reports about me What do they say when you sum them up They say I'm insane. No, it okay. You can nod because it's true. I am insane. She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again. I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. Especially no more sex. I'm going to make it easier for you. She puts on a plastic surgical mask. He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't. It's something else he doesn't recognize. She straddles him again. He squirms under her weight. Lie still.   I've never done this before. 70. 70. He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny strippeddown gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go. There will be some blood. He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ... A127   EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT  DAWN  ESTABLISHING           A127 127    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT  DAWN                           127 The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it. She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach. We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is I AM A RAPIST PIG 128    OMIT   EXT. HEDESTAD  DAWN                              128 129    OMIT   INT.

Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she waves. It's his daughter. Who is it Actually I'm not really up yet Hey.  Hey Who do you think you are If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you. It wasn't meant to be. Wennerstrom wasn't entertained. Blomkvist lets it go. What kind of research Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor. Got it. That's what she's jotting down, from memory the names, initials and Leviticus numbers. She wakes her laptop 141   EXT.

COTTAGE  EVENING                                     166 Blomkvist and Martin drink Skane. Martin's normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mother's public displays. Embarrassed by them and her, he's more serious now. Fine. She comes past them without another word. Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to believe, but he has to ask Everyone in town knows who and where you are. No. Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him. I know. She hands him her own dogeared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed three I'm sure about. Five more Blomkvist stares at her but she's turned back to her laptop, bringing up police reports and crime scene photos. Rebecka was the first, like you thought ...

They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary  Sara, Rakel  all from the Old Testament. It interests me. He takes a blanket from the back of a chair. I can sleep on a couch.

In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's. Going over your notes. Have some coffee. It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos. Too bad you don't have hers. Her. She advances to the next frame    The woman has raised the camera to her eye. And the next Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly. Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever  whoever  Harriet saw at that moment across the street. A, C, Three  the rest is blocked. 96. 96. He focuses on a decal on the car's back window.

Picks up the list again. How's your sex life Bjurman, terrified, backs into a corner. She presses a button and the elevator jerks to a stop between floors. I didn't care much for your last report. It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's. Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod. He nods. 102. 102. Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. He nods. She gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him. He tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded. She lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her. And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again  right here. She touches his forehead. He backs away. The doors open and she steps out, leaving him in there, looking too frightened to move. The doors close. 183   INT.

INSERT   The watch repair shop clock that reads, 200. INSERT   A figure standing slightly apart from the other people. It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket. 184   EXT.

In one she's a stunning young woman.    In the other, the old wreck she's become. He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella changed  and this is where it happened  in this old house out on the point. He untacks the article 103. 103. 186   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND  LATE AFTERNOON                       186 The boathouse   hasn't fared well. Neither has the dock Blomkvist has   to walk on to reach it. He glances inside no boat, just   dark water slapping against the pilings looks back to   the shore at the longuninhabited cabin. 187   INT. CABIN  LATER  LATE AFTERNOON                       187 No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture. Old waterstained books strewn around. Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers. It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know. He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and sees Harriet scrawled in a very young child's hand. 188   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND  LATE AFTERNOON                       188 Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort. A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him  the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him  a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman. Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait. 104. 104. Yes. Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle Yes. No. She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits  still in his pants  halfsubmerged in tepid water  bottle of vodka in his hand. No. Drink some more. He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his face with the needle and floss Don't move. It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh. He pulls away with a groan. She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself. She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad. As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work. Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down. 192A   INT. COTTAGE  A FEW MINUTES LATER  NIGHT               192A He comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed. She works to pull his pants off. 106. 106. No one's shooting at you now. She pulls her tshirt over his stitchedup head, cocooning it against her breasts. Silence. Then Why. He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her. You work with what'shername. That's worked out for you. He nods.   That's true.    Then 107. 107. You need to stop talking. She climbs on top of him. 194    INT.

He's not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms. Eventually You want me to open a window He shakes his head no. Reaches for the cigarette.        Takes a drag. Hands it back. 195    INT. COTTAGE  MORNING                                     195 He wakes. Comes out to find a proper place setting on the table. Sits with Salander. Listens to that awkward, but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning. She breaks it I like working with you. What am I looking for No. I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966. I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers. Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this. Call him. The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up the phone. 203   INT.

MARTIN'S KITCHEN  LATER                             223 Martin pours Scotch.    Hands one to Blomkvist. Mikael He's clearly not here. She goes to the closet. Takes out the surveillance PC. Puts it on the desk  next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying  not the photo of Martin he left for her  but the Apple default light spider screen saver. As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day 229    INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT  CONTINUED                       229 Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show. 128. 128. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ May I kill him Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing  until now. Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him. He nods. 134. 134. She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave I know. She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun. Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She eases around the doorway  the room is empty  looks to the gun case  sees there are only two rifles there now. She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst. She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kickstarts it. 232   EXT. THE BRIDGE  NIGHT                                 232 She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights. Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him. He swerves to try to crush her against the railing but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from  and the tanker truck parked there Martin hits the brakes  hydroplanes into the truck  and its, or his own tank, or both, explode Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could probably brave it to pull Martin out  but doesn't. As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head  but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ... 135. 135. 233   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE  LATER  NIGHT                        233 She finds Blomkvist in the living room.

COTTAGE BEDROOM  MORNING                             235 Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo  the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death. He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor It's open. Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken. Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee. Asleep.   Coffee There's no milk. Frode absently shakes his head no. Sad. Frode isn't sure he heard right.      Regards Salander sipping her coffee. I said it's sad. Let him sleep. It's not a request it's a command. 236   INT. COTTAGE  LATER  MORNING                           236 Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair  all carefully taped into the album.' The older photographs are Polaroids the newer ones digital prints. With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages. Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before reaching the end. Just sits there. We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do. Show them the videos while you're at it. Would you like to see them I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life. He smiles, thinking it's joke.       It isn't, he realizes. Since I was twelve. I tried to kill my father.

He picks them up One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned halfaway from the camera. The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened. I think so. Blomkvist can't look at the photos long.       Sets them down. Something's troubling him I don't like classical music. A strangelooking young man comes in, regards the strange looking trio at the table, comes over. To the fat man Wasp. Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will. The money. Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity. He begins counting it 242   EXT.

Then Okay, what. Fuck these people ... Harriet most of all. If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women. She should have killed her father and him.

Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom He regards her, uncertain what she means ... I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all  you and Harrietfucking Vanger have kept me busy ... but I may have something. Then. It's embarrassing. I need to borrow some money. Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet. 154. 154. 50,000. His grin stays stitched to his face a moment, then unravels. He puts his wallet away. I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe investment. You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two accounts. He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does. You'll get the money back.   I promise. 267   INT.

I want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds. As she writes an account number on a slip of paper from memory, Herr Wagner notices  as she intends  the pen she's using  from the venerable Zimmerstal Hotel. Naturally. Thirty. He glances at his watch, perhaps thinking about lunch. His fauxpoliteness  even his appearance  reminds her of Bjurman. For which you'll receive a 4percent commission. 158. 158. Then it won't be a waste of it. She offers him the Zimmerstal pen. All fifty.   Into five accounts.

Several at street level  a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. He reaches the first of the higherangle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. Harriet isn't in it. But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. In the next, she's further into frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today. 124   OMIT  INT.

The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at twosecond intervals. Too long. Too distracting with the music. And too wide. He adjusts the size function  closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. He hits play' again and watches a short jerky silent film' a kind of electronic flipbook Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him. 126   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT  NIGHT                         126 Bjurman slowly comes to. Ground, please.

MARTIN'S HOUSE  EVENING                             81 Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch. 41. 41. I found him at death's door halfway up the hill. I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. I saw you on Sky News a while ago. 42. 42. Sorry to remind you of it. You're writing a book now, Martin said. I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New. You know about Harriet, right Blomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops. You don't The family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug. Harriet. Martin doesn't comment.    Just nods.    Silence.   Then 43. 43. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ That's one reason. She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it. The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike Blomkvist and Erika.",249
143,MARTIN,THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,0,False," No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. 82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE  NIGHT                               82 A dark day. She comes for the moose steak. Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else What can't. We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me. Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company. We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest familyowned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide  anyone can tell you began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart. And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as innocently as possible Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 430 train. It was a terrible day. And the days after  searching and not finding her were even worse. This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book. 83   INT. STOCKHOLM METRO  DAY                                 83 How long do you think you can hang on Six months or so We still own one. The Courier, here in town. 58. 58. So what do you say to taking on a partner Your independence is dependant on advertisers  if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content. Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a party. Not for the return, that's for sure. Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us. We were talking. He started rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed. I can't talk, Mikael, I have to go Mother Don't be an idiot, Birger. No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants. My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess. 89. 89. Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior. It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking  her state of mind  it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him. And he seems as lost now as he must have been then. You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you can. How do you do. Girlfriend 90. 90. Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him. 108. 108. Or he's right, Dirch.        What if he is This has to stop. Frode regards Blomkvist. I think Henrik would say yes. What do we have to hide If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission. This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them. 197   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND  LATER  DAY                         197 Blomkvist and Salander walk down the road from Martin's house. Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done. 209   INT. ARCHIVES  DUSK                                     209 Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde. The older woman comes back. Drops a set of keys on the desk. Hello   Mikael Blomkvist stops. His heart pounds.      Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car. Your evening stroll I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you something. Come on in, I'll make you a drink. Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp. 220   INT. ARCHIVES  NIGHT                                       220 Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed. She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families. There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute  as everyone else does the same  except for the young man at the far right foreground. He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen. She checks the caption and reads ... far right, Martin Vanger 19, currently studying in Uppsala. 121. 121. Uppsala. Same place as Lena  though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket  the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder. 221   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE  NIGHT                              221 It's not as eerie with the lights on  except for the fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen. What happened to you Now. Blomkvist's clothes.   The fresh mud stains. You don't have a flashlight     I'll give you one. How's the investigation Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up. What I just did. How the investigation's going.      That was his question. You hunt We should go hunting together sometime. Nothing at all what he means New. To report. I can see you're anxious. To get home.    After your walk. To have dinner. With your girlfriend. We'll have better luck with a gun. When we go hunting. Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun. A gun.   Rather than a knife. He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans. There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes. You just couldn't stay away, could you. Blomkvist doesn't know what to say. Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial. 124. 124. I want to show you something.     Bring your drink. Leave the knife. Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now. He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table. 224   INT.

MARTIN'S HOUSE  NIGHT                              226 Martin leads Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go. You know what's harder than shooting someone Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin. Mikael, it did work.     You're here. They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door. Open it. Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal A furnace. Washer. Dryer. Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one. As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks. Push it open. 227   INT.

MARTIN'S BASEMENT  CONTINUED                        228A Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it  a shelf full of Betamax tapes  and a TV monitor on which his own image then appears. Note the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice  which we aren't  is not locked. It's not even completely shut. Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic. It squeaks. He regards Blomkvist calmly.   Sips his drink.    Then almost sighs. Why didn't you just go home. How'd you do it What did you find 126. 126. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does. Then We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you. Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind Of. What does that say Did I If I did, so what.    People lie all the time. Lena ... remember her Lena was a long time ago. Where's this picture now With all the other junk on your desk That's a lie ... How much does the girl know Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ... Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is she And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me  very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold. I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me. 228B   INT. COTTAGE  NIGHT                                    228B As Salander gets the door open with her key and comes in So what would you like to know There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing. You're the journalist, ask me something. Nothing from Blomkvist.   Which is okay with Martin he can do this alone What do I do with my guests Is that the question Well, before  I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot  having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After  I simply get rid of them. Out to sea unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved. Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental. You can't be a sloppy technician like that.   You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess. Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods. society That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really standing there waiting for a train or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean 129. 129. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel special. Didn't it Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too  and at one time it was enough  but explain it A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need ... before destruction. Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a blockandtackle contraption of chains and straps. Can I ask you something Why don't people trust their instincts They sense something's wrong  someone's walking too close behind them  yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong  you even knew what it was  but you came back into the house. Did I force you Did I grab you and drag you in I just offered you a drink. You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain  but you know what It is. They always come willingly. It amazes him.   It always amazes him.   He keeps working. And then they're here. They know it's over like you do  and still somehow think they have a chance. Maybe if I say the right thing  if I'm polite  or I cry and beg  maybe I'll survive. And then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone. 130. 130. And when that happens  when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now between them well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it. Silence ... Say something. ... Is this an interview or an editorial Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ... You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels. Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence.    Then Anything else you want to know You sure All right. Whatever you say. He yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift Blomkvist up onto his feet 230   INT. COTTAGE  NIGHT                                     230 Salander watches the surveillance images, forward Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot. Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside. Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell. Blomkvist going back inside the cottage. Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property. Blomkvist not coming back. Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then 131. 131. Headlights coming through frame. A figure appearing on foot at the front gate. The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage. The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame. 231   INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT  NIGHT                          231 Blomkvist hangs from the blockandtackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet. With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv  who, by the way, finds me very conventional Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses them He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone. What happened to her. You found her You useless fuckin detective. 132. 132. He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now. Did Martin not kill her Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off. Too tight to talk It is.   Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag. Good.   I'm tired of talking to you. He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle. ... Would you like me to do something about that Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate. Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth. See    I'm not a monster. He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too. The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend. 133. 133. Dragon Tattoo Final 9111 SZ He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask. Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes. Brings his own head close to his victim's Goodbye, Mikael. He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ... He turns and sees her  coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door He darts for the gun he left on the workbench Salander just as quickly swings a 5iron  his 5iron like a baseball bat. Its metalwedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor. He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them he's trying to get out Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission",3884

The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets aside and answers the door. Frode comes in. Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself. Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did. A car accident. You found that, too. Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket  changes his mind  changes it again and pulls it out. I was 14 the first time he raped me. No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died. Blomkvist can't hide his horror even after all he's seen. I did.    My mother. Blomkvist stares.   Finally Would he I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did. You still don't understand He doesn't. She studies him, and perhaps sees in him what Salander did long ago  that he can be trusted. A year after the first time after many times during that year my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me. 251   EXT.

Her father can heard inside ranting something from the Bible. I made it out of the house and down to the dock. He came staggering after me Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almostnaked daughter. I could never fight him off in a small room, but I was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk. 146. 146. As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water. He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe. He stares up her, uncomprehending. His fingers slide away from the dock. His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water. When it was finally over I looked up, and Martin was standing there She sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her. With a little smile. 252   EXT.

A couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala. And I thought maybe  maybe  the nightmare was over. Until that day. The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch the smile on young Harriet's face change to fear as she notices something off to the left. There he was  across the street looking at me with that same little smile on his face. A clear shot of young Martin in his Uppsala blazer, standing by the corner, smiling at her. It wasn't over. 147. 147. 254   EXT. PARK  LONDON  CONTINUED                             254 She saved me. 258   EXT. PARK  LONDON  DAY                                   258 Silence.

He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom. But he's not sure if it's Harriet.

Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her. How could you see her  She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween. I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system. What's going on Let me put it this way  total psychotic breakdown. Okay Is that enough Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this. Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot fudge. Oh, Ted. Ted. She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary, folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know what they're talking about. He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.

Yeah, I do. I do. Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with. Yeah. MaybeMaybe I should actually make a greater effort with with Carol. Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.

You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt. He's the man. Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took you out on a date when wewe first started going out. Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner. Not to change the subject. I took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first date Who knew they were flashbacks  You know. Are you gonna burst into a song, here  We're in a car. Let me ask you a personal question, here. Did you ever sleep with Ted Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys... We were on an eating tour of France, together. You two guys spent an evening, you know, together. At that place, you know. That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me. You know that. SheShe thought I was a lowlife and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. JustJust jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know. Hoho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !... Yeah. Oh my god, it is. Can you... Are you sure  Are you sure Oh, my God. I'm... Jesus, I'm sh... That is her. Are you... Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here.

I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard. Mrs. House Hallo I don't... I don't... I don't think she's... This may not be the rightright place. There's nothing here. What's the matter Oh, Jesus. What's the matter WhatWhatWhat... What WhatWhat's... Dead  TTTryTry giving her the present. Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here ! Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon. This woman is forever dying. Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears. Get down those stairs. Come on, come on. Quickly. WeWeWe were there. SheShe was very nervous. SoSo we were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as best as I could. What do you mean, there's nobody up... We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor. She was totally dead. Wait, wait. Yeah, she was definitely laying here. The... YYes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. NotNot that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know. Right, I'm a... II work at Harper's. I'm in publishing. Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, butbut she's a wonderful cook. Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It tooktook you three minutes, notnotnot counting the halfhour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying. Any witnesses Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something. Ted  TedTed's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly. Helen  I don't know and... I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives. We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico. You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car or something. I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see aa dead body. You know, I always hated those shows. I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninetyfour years old. He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals. This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all. Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep, tonight. That'll be good for me. Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean, what do you want me to do  I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk. Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr. House, because he has an alibi. She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get out of here. I want to go home. Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve. You know what I think  I think it's possible. That hotel room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall. It's right up there. That's the room. Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof You know, that would be a possibility. Why would... Oh, Jesus. Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it Yeah, well, let's call the police. Check it out What, are you nuts  No, I'm not gonna check that out. Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the... What do you mean, it's your case Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.

Where did you find it Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open. I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff. We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean  This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this  This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it. Jesus ! What is that Why are we stopping  Why are we stopping Don't tell me to relax !

And a rented body. Oh, Jesus. II can't c... I can't follow his car. Where, up ahead  I don't know which car I'm following here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you know, I'llI'llI'll wind up hitting a school bus or something. Don't tell me that. What about night school You have no sense of direction. I was...

Be careful, be careful, be careful. Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body ! Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped. Good bye, Mrs. House. That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House. I'm gonna call the Police, now. And get them... What are we... Ohhh !... SheSheShe gets cremated. She gets killed at the end. Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh  I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a... Either she's a twin, or he's a twin. Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin. Because I don't know what's going on. You know, look. Let me be logical about this. Hey. Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out. Yeah, I'm going to be logical. The, um, the first thing is this. We came home that night. There had been a heart attack. Uh, what if they induced it  You know, some kind of poison. We never saw the body. You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know. Mrs. House could have been hiding. But youyou remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel. I can't sleep. I just, I... I'm too, you know... I'm too... Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them. Yeah, so what  So what  It's so, you know, TedTed was taking her to a show and tototo dinner... so they'll be there. So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is. Lucky me. Oh, no question about it. It wasIt was Mr. House. There was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there wasthere was just no way that you could avoid it. He was right there. Wh... How do you see it What do you mean That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term ballpark resemblance myself. It was my idea. I said what she said. This is my theory. Exactly my theory. Yeah. That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague. Cheating on two women The guy doesn't look the part. She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him. She's right, there's no body. Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying attention  This is a great theory. I think it's great. Oh, excuse me. Her mind, it just goes. Fantastic. I knew that they would hit it off. III knew this. What are you talking about I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you  I'm her editor. I'm I'm a father figure to her, how... You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia What'd wrong with you  You're jealous because he'she's interested in her. You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most. Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, soso... Right. Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call. This is perfect. No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never... This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because sshe's a, she's aan, actress, or wouldbe actress, anyhow, and you'reyoure... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow. Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything. And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we taperecord it. Listen to this. And we edit it up.

You know what I mean  I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry. Oh my God ! Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. III heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, II looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator. Yeah, you know, I was... I'mI'm... almost certain that it was him. Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be I know. I know. But whwho would it be at onethirty in the morning But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying  A joke I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home. Yes, because this is really... It's very sus...

All right. Oh, God. Ted... I'm in his apartment. The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel. He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay  Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, II'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done. Oh, stop being such a fuddydud. Yeah. It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in. Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay Okay He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. I told Ted. Yeah. He's more openminded about these things. Yeah. Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay He talked on the phone with a woman. Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so... Yeah, but I hid under the bed. He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all. He wasHe was very loveydovey with his kind of bimbo, you know  He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together. That kind of thing. I know, listen, II couldn't think that far ahead. No, I c... Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. HeHe called this woman back. Probably thisthis Helen Moss woman, right And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says  Tell her Tom called. You know what I'm saying  Tom. Tom, Larry. Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did... I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake. I left my reading glasses on his table. Oh, hallo. Hi. II thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert. I thought I'dI'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious.

I mean, who's the guy Ted. Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your date. To me, it's obvious. Obvious he's committed the perfect murder. Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. They're with this woman. Maybe having dinner. They don't induce a heart attack, because that's fiction bullshit. She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously. They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she was dead. I don't know. Maybe they stood to gain if she died. They see a golden opportunity. Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides. That's right. She checks into a hotel. Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with this pretty young woman. He's cheating on his wife. So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he doublecrosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits. Yeah, a good chance she's aware. She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his wife. She said he was at work all day. She's a colleague who maybe loves him. The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder. There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free. Well, he doesn't care. Why should he  Everything's been neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth. When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to trap him. Okay, I've got it. Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no case. Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know  He was probably too scared to be very lucid. He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow  who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now, you can send him to the chair. If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down. Well, that's when we keep bluffing. We produce the body. Yeah. SaySay we found someone to corroborate this story. Someone he trusted. Like his lover. Say she called and said, Paul, I've just seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars for it. Remember that book you recommended to me  Murder in Manhattan In the book, they use several tape recorders. We coordinate it. He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks. Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder. What It's perfect. It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You shake him down. He comes after you, we nab him. Yeah. It's either that, or he walks. Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right Hi. Perfect.

Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time. Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years ago. She changed her name when she married. Her husband died. She moved back to New York recently, a very, very rich widow... but a recluse. Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will. They have her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over. I guessed right there. She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they fake it... Pretend Lillian House died. They cremate the sister. Lillian checks into a fleabag joint... and for several weeks she pretends to be her sister... closing her accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money. What she didn't realize was that her husband was twotiming her with Helen Moss, this pretty model. So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So, he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came along and tripped him up. Yeah, that woman that worked for him Mrs. Dalton  She covered for him. She loved him. Not that she dreamed he was a murderer. I think they wanna be alone.

224,JO,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, I'd like to request that I be the attorney assigned to rep  I'd like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent That it be myself who is assigned to represent ...Good, Jo, that's confidence inspiring. Thank you, sir. Yes sir. Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on such short notice. Yes sir... This past Friday evening. Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 400 this afternoon. Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screwup. I was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red. I'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that... I be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them. Myself. Thank you, sir, I'm fine. Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir. But... not me. Sir You're the attorney that Division assigned Come in, please, have a seat... Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy And how long have you been out of law school I see. No. It's just that when I petitioned Division to have counsel assigned, I was hoping I'd be taken seriously. Have you ever been in a courtroom No. They'll need a lawyer. Dawson's family has been contacted. Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side, she hasn't been Contacted yet. Would you like me to take care of that One of the people you'll be speaking to down there is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've heard of him. These are letters that Santiago wrote in his 8 months at GITMO He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody was listening. You with me This last letter to the Naval investigative Service where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort. Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago. The victim. Yes, among other Colonel Jessep, yes, but I'm sorry You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper. You're gonna have to go deeper than just My job is to make sure you do your job. I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. Read the letters. You're not under any obligation, but I'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba. You're dismissed. Tell your friend not to get cute down there.  The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical. About being marines. Excuse me. No, thank you, I can't throw and catch things. I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey. Dawson and Downey. Dawson! Downey! Your clients! I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball. That wasn't funny. Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel I don't think you're fit to handle this defense. I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fastfood, slickass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre determined the path of least resistance. I don't think your clients murdered anybody. There was no intent. Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison. I'm gonna speak to your supervisor. Thank you. Do you know what a code red is What a pity. M.P. Officer on deck, tenhut. Hi there. Is there anyone in this command that you don't either drink or play softball with Listen, I came to make peace. We started off on the wrong foot. What do you say Friends By the way, I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for. The kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't even know why he's been arrested. You can call me Joanne. or Jo. Yes. I had authorization. Downey's closest living relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side. I gave her a call like you asked. Very nice woman, we talked for about an hour. Perfectly within my province. I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow. Commander Galloway. Thank you. Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud! Colonel. The JAG Corps can be demanding that way. Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered You planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour Wait a minute, I've got some questions. Yes I do. Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five I was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red. Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers. My point is that I think code reds still go on down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel Yes he does. Yeah, he really does. Colonel Colonel, the practice of code Reds is still condoned by officers on this base, isn't it I need an answer to my question, sir. It's me. Markinson resigned his commission. This afternoon. Sometime after we left. I already tried, I can't find him. I'm Louden Downey's attorney. Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she's known me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago. Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel. I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. So do you. Alright. Let's sort this out. There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt. Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago. Now is that true I want you to speak freely. And what happened then How long have you known about the order I'm accusing you of No deal, we're going to a jury. Why not No. Let's go in another room. Louden, everything's gonna be alright. We're gonna go into a holding room. M.P. Aye, aye, ma'am. Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely. I want you to let 'em be judged! I want you to stand up and make an argument! Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument. Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer Were daddy's expectations really that high Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win. You know they have a case. And you know how to win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate. Do you believe they have a defense You know nothing about the law. You're a used car salesman, Daniel. You're an ambulance chaser with a rank. You're nothing. Live with that. Yeah. I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first. Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean As long as we're on the subject of the doctor Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison The doctor's covering up the truth. Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway, I'm an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. I'm trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC... He resigned his commission a week ago Thursday. No, please don't put me on hold Object. Nice. And what happened after Kendrick came into your room Really! I'll give you a ride. Danny I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow. We're ready. Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt. Your Honor, we renew our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony. Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection. Exception. I got it on the record. Why do you hate them so much 'Cause they stand on a wall. And they say Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight. Not on my watch. I'm sorry to bother you, I should've called first. I was wondering if  how you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight. No. I wasn't. Do you like seafood I know a good seafood place. My third case was a Drunk and Disorderly. The trial lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people who were in the bar that night. 15 days. After that, they moved me to internal affairs. Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation. Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer. No you don't. I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you. We'll find Markinson. Where is he I want him guarded. This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My clearance code is 411273. Thank you. It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness. Damn. Yes. We're gonna win. Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now. Private Downey, why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th And why did you give him a Code Red You're gonna do fine. Absolutely. You remember the order of the questions Are you sure And you'll use small words He gets rattled when he doesn't understand something. I'm just saying go slow. Okay. And get him off as fast as you can. What Please the court, I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client. The witness has rights. Your honor Where do you think he is As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick. It didn't matter that he didn't hear it first hand. He doesn't distinguish between the two. Danny. I'm sorry. Sam and I were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses who'll talk about implied orders... or maybe we put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson. Are you drunk I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a long night's work ahead. Danny, it was just a setback. I'm sorry. But we'll fix it and then move on to Markinson. I still think we can win. Look, we'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance. 24 hours. To subpoena Colonel Jessep. Listen for a second Just hear me out You chickenshit. You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order Why! Bullshit! You could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. You had an instinct. And it was confirmed by Markinson. Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing! He told Kendrick to order the Code Red. I You put him on the stand and you get it from him! I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives. I say we hit him with the phoney transfer order. What I put it in the closet. I was tripping over it. He thinks better with his bat What's goin' on Not yet. He's on his way. Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a second How're you feeling Listen. Danny. When you're out there. If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it ...don't go for it. If you feel like... if you feel like... You could get in trouble. I'm special counsel for internal affairs, and I'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble. If you think you can't get him. Yeah. I think it doesn't matter what I think. I'm an administrator. I can't seem to defend people. He'll be here. I know, but It's not as simple as What do you say we take the rest of the day off. Go out someplace.

Requested to do what What's a fenceline Teachers pet. They poisoned the rag What do they say The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the morning, sir Hi. I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet with Commander Galloway. About a briefing. I'm lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg. Going on nine months now. A little over a year. Have I done something wrong No offense taken, if you were wondering. One more, and I got a set of steak knives. I once had my drivers license suspended. Commander, from what I understand, if this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest. Sure, if you feel like it. Who hasn't I know that one. Yes. Right. Is that all Gotcha. And Santiago is... who Write that down. Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy. Twelve years. Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years. Pretty impressive, huh Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about Sure. Sorry, I always forget that. Alright, let's get tough out there! You want to suit up We need all the help we can get. That's okay, neither can they. Say again Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but I'm just not The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey. Right. I've done something wrong again, haven't I We need the practice. It was a little funny. Why You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense. Oh come on, that was damn funny. Wow. I'm sexually aroused, Commander. What are you basing this on The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad. Oh, now I see what you're saying. It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick. Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a big white house with pillars in front. I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself. Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold. I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinerg, you can sitdown. Is this your signature You don't have to call me sir. Is this your signature And you certainly don't have to do it twice in one sentence. Harold, what's a Code Red What does that mean, exactly What's a garden variety Code Red Harold, you say sir and I turn around and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, Kaffee. Garden variety typical. What's a basic Code Red What's that Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red Do you ever talk Swell. Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was there poison on it Silver polish, turpentine, anti freeze... When all of a sudden... Did anyone see you call the ambulance Were you there when the ambulance got there His mirror engaged Santiago's letter to the NIS said you fired illegally. He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move. Oh, Harold You see what I'm getting at If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red He what Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him What was your intent Train him to do what The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country We'll be back. You guys need anything Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to. I'm the only friend you've got. Sailin' Jack Ross. You think so Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin' at I want twelve. They called the ambulance, Jack. The rag was tested for poison.  The autopsy, lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the same thing Maybe, maybe not. What do you know about Code Reds You tell me. I'll talk to you when I get back. Any luck getting me replaced Commander Look, I don't Commander Joanne Jo Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission, I'll have you disbarred. Friends From where You got authorization from Aunt Ginny You got authorization from Aunt Ginny. Does Aunt Ginny have a barn We can hold the trial there. I can sew the costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge. And the hits just keep on comin'. How's it goin', Luther You gotta play 'em as they lay, Luther. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Love makes the world go round. I'll see you tomorrow, Luther. Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm not sure it was a word. Okay. She was pointing at a doorknob. Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered me twelve years. I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean I'll take it. It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight. You don't believe their story, do you You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. I'll see you tomorrow. I don't like the whites. Dramamine keeps you cool I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll help. Yeah, right. You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago. I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is. What the hell. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Camouflage jackets Good call, Sam. Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat! Nobody said anything about a boat. No. No problem. I'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all. Nobody likes her very much. Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey. This is Joanne Galloway, she's observing and evaluating Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility here whatsoever. Yes sir. He passed away seven years ago, colonel. Not at all, sir. Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. This is really a formality more than anything else. The JAG Corps insists that I interview all the relevant witnesses. Fine, sir. I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon. What'd you guys talk about What time was that meeting Sam, somebody should see about getting this stuff to his parents. We don't need it anymore. Lt. Kendrick  can I call you Jon Have I done something to offend you Sounds good. Let's move on. I'm pacing myself. Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th. On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting. Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, you should free to speak up. Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office And what happened then Santiago was set to be transferred Yeah. Alright, that's all I have. Thanks very much for your time. Thank you. No you don't. No you don't. Jo See The man was dead. Let's go. Jo She has no point. She often has no point. It's part of her charm. We're outta here. Thank you. Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that. No, he really doesn't. Yes sir. Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order. Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paper work on that kind of thing, I just need it for the file. Yeah. Thank you. Of course. Let's go. I beg your pardon Colonel Jessep... if it's not too much trouble, I'd like a copy of the transfer order. Sir. Who is it I've really missed you, Jo. I was just saying to myself, It's been almost three hours since I last saw  When I'll talk to him in the morning. You tried Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation. I suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me. Splendid. Did Kendrick order the code red Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red Did he You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before Cutiepie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail. Fuck you, Harold. When And what happened then Jack! Jack!! They were given an order. This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you. Jack didn't know about the order. Because if he did and he hadn't told us, Jack knows he'd be violating about 14 articles of the code of ethics. As it is, he's got enough to worry about. God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order. That's right. And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room and specifically told them to give him a code red. Kendrick's lying. I have the defendants. Why did Markinson resign his commission You don't think I can subpoena Markinson. How much room Jo Here's the story The Goverment's offering Assault and Conduct Unbecoming. Two years. You'll be home in six months. Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest lawyer in the world. How can we ever thank you Fellas, you hear what I just said, you're going home in six months. Do what What are you talking about Did you Did she put you up to this Well zippitydoodah. You and your code plead not guilty and you'll be in jail for the rest of your life. Do what I'm telling you and you'll be home in six months. Do it, Harold. Six months. It's nothing. It's a hockey season. Speak! When Yes. Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute. You don't like me that much, do you Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter. You know, Downey worships you. He's gonna do whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code Harold It doesn't matter what I I think you'd lose. I'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold. I did everything I could. You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what I don't give a shit. M.P.! What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business. I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way down. I want to get him a new lawyer. How do I do it Then that's that. What do you want from me For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm These guys aren't the Nazis. Yeah. Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new attorney. Please, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer. Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died. You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland. It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. So please don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law. Yeah. They're not guilty. Why does a junior grade with six months experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom We'll work out of my apartment. Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before you come over tonight, pick up a carton of legal pads, a halfdozen boxes of red pens, a halfdozen boxes of black pens. Sam get a couple of desk lamps. I need you to start on a preliminary medical profile and Jo, we need all the fitness reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The only thing I have to eat is YooHoo and SugarSnacks, so if you want anything else, bring it with you. Okay So this is what a courtroom looks like. INTENT             CODE RED             THE ORDER Were you able to speak to your friend at NIS Are you Markinson Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two down. What. They were following an order, Sam. You think Dawson and Downey know it was an illegal order They're not permitted to question orders. We have softball games and marching bands. They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot. I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness. This is our defense. Intent No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order A Kendrick gave it. B They had no choice but to follow it. That's it. We're a little weak on motive. They had one. Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone. Here we go. Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information. No CliffNotes on these things Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there any other sign of external damage No scrapes No cuts Bruises Broken bones Doctor, was there any sign of violence Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam time! Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary action, or training'' as you say Please the Court, I maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of, among others, the witness. He's right, and from now on, Willy is Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him. Poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the jury. Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head, don't shift in your seat, don't scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me documents And don't wear that perfume in Court, it wrecks my concentration. I was talking to Sam. Time to go home. Try to get some sleep tonight. You're a good man, Charlie Brown. I know what you're gonna say. You don't have to. We've had our differences. I've said some things I didn't mean, you've said some things you didn't means but you're happy that I stuck with the case. And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course I'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it. You like me. I won't make you say it. Oh. Okay. Good tip. Bet your ass. We're gonna get creamed. I'll do my best. You're Aunt Ginny I'm sorry, I was expecting someone older. Last chance. I'll flip you for it. No objection. There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Let me say that again It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job. How you doin' Good. Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting But you don't believe him. Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause Thank you. Object Please the Court, is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on August 6th Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks room ten minutes after this meeting Thanks, I have no more questions. Please the Court, I understand Lt. Ross is planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify. The defense is willing to concede that all 23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and Downey's room at 1620 on August 6th. Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating. Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive. Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn. Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal. Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically Commander, is it possible What might some of those conditions be Commander, if I had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam What kind of symptoms Chest pains Shortness of breath Fatigue Doctor, is this your signature This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir. Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander 'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor No more questions, judge. Sam Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not relive it. Alright. Everybody take the night off. It's alright. We've been working 20 hour days for three and a half weeks straight. Take the night off. Go see your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do whatever it is you do when you're not here. What day is tomorrow We'll start at ten. No, I was just watching a baseball game. Jo, are you asking me out on a date It sounded like you were asking me out on a date. I've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like. Nine weeks on a D and D What was the prosecutor offering Well, you sure hustled the shit outta him. Tough to blame them. Why are you always giving me your resume I do. Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. Ross's opening speech, it was all true. I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder. Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge. Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red Have you ever received a code red And what happened Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings Was his barracks ever in disorder Did he ever fall back on a run Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red Never You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one Dawson wouldn't allow it. I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red Why didn't you Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now. Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is I don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book No more questions. Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review. I want to slam dunk this guy. Hey, Luther. Nose to the grindstone. A rolling stone gathers no moss. Ain't that the truth. Catch you tomorrow. Jesus fucking Christ!! Scared the shit outta me. Are you aware you're under subpoena What do you know Was it a code red Did Kendrick give the order Did you witness it Did you witness it! Then how do you know You know shit. We've got the transfer order. It's got your signature. I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me. Right now I'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning. The Route 23 Best Western. That's probably a good idea. Clearance code I don't have a clearance code. Do you have a He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier. That was impressive. Did you hear what I just said about the flight Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right Get it. Jo, don't get crazy about this. We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the log book's gonna say. You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are. You are like seven of the strangest women I have ever met. I have Markinson. A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink. The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney. And Jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. But in the meantime I'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun. Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something. I've been so advised. You're a lousy softball player, Jack. Batter up, J.J. Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good marine Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on Santiago. On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below Average. We appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and I think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth. Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey received three straight marks of Exceptional. Dawson received two marks of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this year, he received a rating of Below Average. It's this last report that I'd like to discuss for a moment. Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after Infantry Training School was perfect. Records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has remained a lance corporal. Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report. Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officer's Club Did you report private Barnes to the proper authorities Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority. Did you report Private Barnes to your superiors You preferred it to be handled within the unit. Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red is Have you ever ordered a code red Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days I'm sure it was lovely for Private Barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you And you did order the denial of food. Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red If I called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to Private Barnes Not so fast. Lieutenant What crime did he commit Lieutenant Kendrick Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. Lt. Kendrick Can he Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am I right You know so, don't you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red... is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again You don't have to, I'm through. What's the word Let me see that. There was no flight out at eleven o'clock. What the fuck are you trying to pull Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log! What are you telling me He fixed the log book Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I'll get the log book from Andrews. He made an entire flight disappear You're taking the stand. Thursday. There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight. A ground crew member. Someone. Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order. That'll be enough. That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough. Yes. Yes. Yes. Jo I'm gonna go slow. Alright. Joanne! He's gonna be fine. Private, I want you to tell us one last time Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th Thank you. Your witness. Don't worry about it. Maybe if we work at it we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination. Pretty much. Yeah. She's gonna make coffee. That's nice. He wasn't in his room. He wasn't even there. That was an important piece of information, don't you think Markinson's dead. You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy. laugh It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife. This guy got, into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth. Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little. Then maybe you should drink a little. Why would we want to do that What No. No. I won't listen to you and I won't hear you out. Your passion is comforting, Jo. It's also useless. Private Downey needed a trial lawyer today. It's over! What are you What does it matter I wanted the damn transfer order! What possible good could come from putting Jessep on the stand He did! Why didn't you say so! That's qreat! And of course you have proof of that. Ah, I keep forgetting You were sick the day they taught law at law school. Yes. No problem. We get it from him. Colonel, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, Judge Well, for our defendants it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee That's right  it's  a court  martial. Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt. Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Columbo School for Women. Thank you for playing Should We or ShouldWeNot Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid. Stop cleaning up. Sam. Stop cleaning up. You want a drink Is your father proud of you I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. Sam, made Law Review. He's got a big case he's making He's arguing making an argument. I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. I think he would've liked that... an awful lot. Yeah Yes he was. Would you put Jessep on the stand You think my father would've Joanne. Jo, we look ridiculous. Stop the car. Joanne. I apologize. I was angry and... I'm sorry about what I said. I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand. We have a witness. And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem. I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of you. Good. Jessep told Kendrick to order a code red. Kendrick did, and our clients followed the order. The coverup isn't our case. To win, Jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red. I think he wants to say it. I think he's pissed off that he's gotta hide from us. I think he wants to say that he made a command decision and that's the end of it. He eats breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one's gonna tell him how to run his base. Least of all the pushy broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard clown. I need to shake him and put him on the defensive. That's the plan. I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna lead him right where he's dying to go. I have no idea. I need my bat. I need my bat. I think better with my bat. Where's my bat You put it in the closet. Don't ever put a bat in a closet. Stay here, I'm going to the office for a while. Sam. I need you to do something. Is Sam here Where is he Did he got the guys I think he's gonna have his hands full today. Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are you suggesting I back off a material witness Do you think I can get him You're my hero, Joanne. From the first day, you were a lawyer. Live with that. Where's Sam Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep. Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson. And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right I'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive. I just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol. Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well Why Grave danger We have the transfer order that you and Markinson cosigned, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight off the bass Colonel, you flew up to Washington early this morning, is that right I notice you're wearing your Class A appearance in dress uniform for court today. Did you wear that uniform on the plane The defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor. I'd ask the Court for a little latitude. Colonel And you brought your dress uniform with you. And a toothbrush A shaving kit Change of underwear Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security Yes sir. Colonel Thank you. After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth, Santiago's barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried. Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki teeshirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed. I'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute. This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls. I've highlighted those calls in yellow. Do you recognize those numbers Why did you make that call, sir Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel. Colonel Is this funny, sir Do you have an answer Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you. I'm not through with my examination. Sit down. What's that Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m. Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits A and B. We believe it did, sir. then motioning to the AIRMEN Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh. Colonel, a moment ago We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago. And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted Any chance Kendrick ignored the order Any chance he just forgot about it Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, The 'old man's wrong When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him No sir. No sir. No sir. Yes sir. Crystal. Colonel, I have just one more question before I call Airman O'Malley and Airman Perez If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base But that's not what you said. You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger. You said, He was in danger. I said, Grave danger. You said I can have the Court Reporter read back your Then why the two orders Colonel Why did you No sir. You made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands. Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago shouldn't have been in any danger at all, should he have, Colonel I'd like an answer to the question, Judge. If Kendrick told his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched, then why did he have to be transferred Colonel Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't he Because that's what you told Kendrick to do. And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose. You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order You doctored the log books. I'll ask for the forth time. You ordered I think I'm entitled to them. I want the truth. Did you order the code red Did you order the code red Please the court, I suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session. The witness has rights. Jack. Don't call me son. I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy. And you're under arrest you sonofabitch. The witness is excused. SLOW DISSOLVE TO Harold, I'm sorry. Harold! You don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor. Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna testify, under oath, that they have absolutely no recollection of anything. And very handsome, too, don't you think Tell him I say Hi. Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He went to the movies on company time. What about you Just pretty much generally annoying people No. How 'bout a date. A real date. Dinner. Attractive clothes.

Sitdown, this first one's for you. You're moving up in the world, Danny, you've been requested by Division. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline and into Cuban territory. Sam PFC William Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson to the Naval investigative Service. Dawson and another member of his squad, PFC Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's room, tie him up, and stuff a rag down his throat. An hour later, Santiago's dead. Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin. Not according to them. Not much. They're being flown up here tomorrow and on Thursday at 0600 you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day to find out what you can. Meantime, go across the yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. She's the one who had 'em brought up here. She'll fill you in on whatever she has.

234,SAM,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," I think she's ready to say her first word any day now. She just looks like she has something to say. A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys. No. I have a stack of paper on my desk Doing what Kaffee'll finish this up in four days. In other words I have no responsibilities whatsoever. My kinda case. I have no responsibilities here whatsoever. Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally considered the best litigator in our office. He's successfully plea bargained 44 cases in nine months. Danny He's been in the papers lately. He's expected to be appointed Director of Operations for the National Security Counsel. Guantanamo Bay. He's a little preoccupied. The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week. About what Beautiful. On the night of August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba Why For each American sentry post there's a Cuban counterpart. They're called mirrors. The corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him. What's the code I beg your pardon When Nancy gets back, you're my witness. The baby spoke. My daughter said a word. Oh come on, it was a word. You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed, and said Pa. She did. She said Pa. That's right. Pointing, as if to say, Pa, look, a doorknob. That's what you wanted. So Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift. I believe every word they said. And I think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there. Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August. You got Dramamine Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly. I've got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good. So Four o'clock. How do you feel about that theory You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment. The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell him you want new counsel assigned. An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg. She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we're not gonna find him. She said I could be Markinson and you wouldn't know it. No. I was wondering, now that Joanne's working on this... I was wondering if you still need me. An illegal order. It doesn't matter if they know, any decent human being would've refused to Then what's the secret What are the magic words I give orders every day, and nobody follows them. Did you get any dumplings What about motive Cartons 3 and 4. No. No. No. You mean other than the dead body Don't ask the last question. His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth. What time is it See you in court. I strenuously object Is that how it works Objection. Overruled. No, no, no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, well if you strenuously object, let me take a moment to reconsider. You also got it in the jury's head that we're afraid of the doctor. You object once so they can hear you say he's not a criminologist. You keep after it and it looks like this great cross we did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks. It's the difference between paper law and trial Christ, you even had the Judge saying Stone was an expert! I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet you tonight. They beat up on a weakling, and that's all they did. The rest is just smokefilled coffeehouse crap. They tortured and tormented a weaker kid. They didn't like him. And they killed him. And why Because he couldn't run very fast. I apologize, I, Saturday. Why do you like them so much Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday. We need the Tower Chief's Log for GITMO. This is the tower chief's log for that night. Jessep was telling the truth. The six a.m. flight was the first plane out. Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day A kid from the ground crew isn't gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago. Look, we're all a little Yeah. Don't do this to yourself. Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on your father in college He was one of the best trial lawyers ever. And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick. No. With the evidence we've got Not in a million years. But here's the thing and there's really no way of getting around this  neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So there's only one question. What would you do What's the transfer order without a witness A dead witness. Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound. And you think you can got him to just say it That's it That's the plan You're gonna trip Jessep and he's gonna confess. And how are you gonna do that I can understand that. I used to have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I could never do my home work without him. Boy, he does think better with that bat. I've gotta go out to Andrews. Yes you did! A jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine. What does that mean! You're the marine. Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home and talk to my daughter.

235,SANTIAGO,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," Dear Sir, ...My name is PFC William T. Santiago. I am a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Delta. I am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps. P.S. In exchange for my transfer off the base, I'm willing to provide you with information about an illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2nd.",191
236,JESSEP,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago. Yeah, well, apparently he's not very happy down here at ShangriLa, cause he's written letters to everyone but Santa Claus asking for a transfer. And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting. Matthew You're appalled This kid broke the Chain of Command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and it would appear that he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's going on over at Windward, Matthew And I'm yours, Matthew. I want to know what we're gonna do about this. He's that bad, huh Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose you're right. I suppose that's the thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a better idea. Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's  on second thought  Windward. The whole Windward division, let's transfer 'em off the base. Jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence, they're packing their bags. Tom! Got me the President on the phone, we're surrendering our position in Cuba. Wait a minute, Tom. Don't call the President just yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second. Maybe  and I'm just spit balling here  but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago. Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. Yes. I'm certain I once read that somewhere. And now I'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way. Santiago stays where he is. We're gonna train the lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I'm gonna blame you. Then I'm gonna kill you. Matthew, I believe I will have that word in private with you now. Jon, that's all. Why don't you and I have lunch at the O club, we'll talk about the training of young William. Dismissed. Matthew, sit, please. What do you think of Kendrick I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. But he's an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit. We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew. That's a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously. And I believe that taking a marine who's not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger. Matthew, siddown. We go back a while. We went to the Academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our tours in Vietnam together. But I've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have. Now if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you, well, I don't give a shit. We're in the business of saving lives, Captain Markinson. Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer. Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown. Pleased to meet you, Commander. I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick to join us. Lionel Kaffee Well what do you know. Son, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods. Jefferson vs. Madison County School District. The folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all white school, Lionel Kaffee said we'll just see about that. How the hell is your dad Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, asshole. Well, what can we do for you, Danny. Jonanthan'll take you out and show you what you wanna see, then we can all hook up for lunch, how does that sound ...And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to. STEWARDS That was delicious, men, thank you. Shoot. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base. On the first available flight to the states. Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out. Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead. I've heard the term, yes. I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Sovietmade Cuban MlAl6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo You know it just hit me. She outranks you, Danny. I want to tell you something Danny and listen up 'cause I mean this You're the luckiest man in the world. There is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning. Promote 'em all I say. You see my problem is, of course, that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have to keep taking cold showers 'til they elect some gal President. Take caution in your tone, Commander. I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous. What's that For the file. Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order. For the file. I'm here to help anyway I can. You believe that, don't you Danny That I'm here to help anyway I can The corporal'll run you by Ordinance on your way out to the airstrip. You can have all the transfer orders you want. But you have to ask me nicely. You have to ask me nicely. You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. I can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear. I don't want money and I don't want medals. What I want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform, and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin' courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely. No problem. I hate casualties, Matthew. There are casualties even in victory. A marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon, that marine's a hero. The foundation of the unit, the fabric of this base, the spirit of the Corps, they are things worth fighting for. Dawson and Downey, they don't know it, but they're smothering a grenade. Yes I do. Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Yes. Yes. I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched. I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately. I felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out. Is there another kind The six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base. Yes. As are you, Lieutenant. I wore fatigues on the plane. Yes. I brought a change of clothes and some personal items. I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him know I'd be in town. The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth. I thought she might like to have dinner tonight. No. It's not. It's tragic. Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago.  What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer Phone calls and footlockers Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill. Do you have any other questions for me, counselor Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. I beg your pardon. Colonel. I'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've earned it. I don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here. What would you like to discuss now! My favorite color Yes. This is ridiculous. Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake. That's right. Crystal. Ignored the order No. No. Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son Ever served in a forward area Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear Are we clear Private Santiago was a substandard marine. He was being transferred off the base because Yes. That's correct, but Yes, I recall what I know what I said. I don't need it read back to me like I'm a damn Sometimes men take matters into their own hands. You little bastard. You want answers You want answers! You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it You You, Lt. Weinberg I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to. I did the job you sent me to do. You're goddamn right I did. What the hell's going on Captain, what the hell's going on I did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm getting on a plane and going back to my base. What the hell I'm being charged with a crime I'm that's what this is Marine! Marine!! job. I'm being charged with a crime I'm that's what's happening This  I'm this is funny, you know that, this is I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine. I saved lives. That boy was  there was a weak link. I saved lives, you hear me You fuckin' people. You have no idea how to defend a nation. All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did. You put people in danger. Sweet dreams, son.",1984

Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear any suggestions you have. Yes. I told the men that there was an informer among us. And that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution, Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way. Sixteenhundred. Actually, the uniforms belong to the marine corps. No, you may not. No, I like all you Navy boys. Every time we've gotta go someplace and fight, you fellas always give us a ride. Commander, I believe in God, and in his son Jesus Christ, and because I do, I can say this Private Santiago is dead and that's a tragedy. But he's dead because he had no code. He's dead because he had no honor. And God was watching. The corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip. I'd say he was about average. Yes. Private Santiago was Below Average I didn't see the need in trampling on a man's grave. I'm aware of my oath. That's fine. I'm sure it was. I'm sure I don't. I have many men in my charge, Lieutenant, I write many fitness reports. Yes. I have two books at my bedside, Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct and the King James Bible. The only proper authorities I'm aware of are my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan R. Jessep and the Lord our God. I remember thinking very highly of Private Barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge. I most certainly did. Yes I do. No, I have not. That's a distortion of the truth. Private Barnes was placed on barracks restriction. He was given water and vitamin supplements, and I assure you that at no time was his health in danger. Yes. Not necessarily. Corporal Dawson was found to be Below Average because he committed a crime. He disobeyed an order. Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order. No, he can not. I would think so. I told those men not to touch Santiago. No I did not.",363
238,MARKINSON,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," I'm appalled, sir. Colonel, I think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private. The same way you handled the Curtis Barnes incident You're doing something wrong, Lieutenant this Don't interrupt me, I'm still your superior officer. I think Santiago should be transferred off the base. Right away. Not only that, but word of this letter's bound to get out. The kid's gonna get his ass kicked. I think that's a mistake, Colonel. I don't know that Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of seeing your father once. I was a teenager and he spoke at my high school. You left the door unlocked. Drive. Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that, I would, but since I can't, all I can do is help you. Why don't you drive, Lieutenant. I know everything. Yes. Yes. I didn't need to No. I know. He was never gonna be transferred off the base. Jessep was going to keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained. I know. I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba. Six days after Santiago died. I don't want a deal. And I don't want immunity. I want you to know, I'm proud neither of what I've done nor what I'm doing. The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two. Why the hell did you think it would be!! Nathan Jessep is about to be named Director of Operations for the National Security Council. You don't get to that position without knowing how to sidestep a few land mines. And putting me on the stand isn't gonna make him step on one. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago... I was William's company commander. I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name... In a matter of time, the trial of the two man charged with your son's death will be concluded, and seven men and two women whom you've never met will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead. For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light. And the truth is this your son is dead for only one reason. I wasn't strong enough to stop it. Always, Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson. United states marine corps.",412

The men in his squad would give him a G.I. shower. Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel wool... Yes sir. Sir, Private Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him. No sir. Yes sir, that's when we were taken under arrest. Yes sir. My mirror engaged, sir. Because he broke the chain of command, sir. He went outside his unit, sir.

But'I won't say I'm guilty, sir. We have a code, sir. Permission to What do we do then, sir After six months.

And now you're asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor. You're asking us to say we're not marines. If a judge and jury decide that what we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever punishment they give. But I believe I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my job. And I won't dishonor myself, my unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo home in six months. Sir. Do you think we were right Do you think we were right You're such a coward, I can't believe they let you wear a uniform. Private. Answer the Lieutenant's question. Why Why! We did nothing wrong.

241,ROSS,A FEW GOOD MEN,0,False," Dan Kaffee. Welcome to the big time. I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball. They plead guilty to manslaughter, I'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll be home in half that time. Can't do it. I don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine. The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure. Oh man. Are we off the record I'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago. Hey, we got a little fouronfour going tomorrow night. When does your plane get in Hang on... I didn't Who is this What exactly are you accusing me of, commander Kendrick specifically told the men not to touch Santiago. That's not what Kendrick said. You have proof And I have 23 marines who aren't accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation. We'll never know. You can try, but you won't find him. You know what Markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps Counter Intelligence. Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson. Jessep's star is on the rise. Division'll give me a lot of room to spare Jessep and the corps any embarrassment. I'll knock it all down to assault. Two years. They're home in six months. No you're not. 'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it. And he knows that if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way, they'll be charged with the whole truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct Unbecoming, and even though he's got me by the balls out here, Dan knows that in a courtroom, he loses this case. Danny's an awfully talented lawyer, and he's not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months. That's the end of this negotiation. From this moment, we're on the record. I'll see tomorrow morning at the arraignment. Too late. No objection, your honor. Yes sir. The facts of the case are this At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoonmate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire. Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year What did the letter say Was that marine identified in the letter And what did you find And who was that Your witness. Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter. And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire No more questions. Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lt. Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of second platoon. Would you tell the Court the substance of that meeting Did that make you mad You can tell the truth, corporal, it's alright. Did it make you mad How mad Were the other members of the squad angry Were Dawson and Downey Corporal, did Lt. Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting What was it What was the order Your witness. The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas In light of the defense that Lt. Kaffee is planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony. The Government'll agree to the stipulation, sir. Dr. Stone, what's lactic acidosis How long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar And what caused Santiago's muscles and other cells to start burning sugar Commander Stone is an expert medical witness, in this courtroom his opinion isn't considered speculation. Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison Then how do you justify Thank you, sir. Object. Move to strike. Dr. Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned Thank you, sir, I have no more questions. Please the Court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises, the Government rests. Object. The witness is characterizing. Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book Have you read it Good. Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please. Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds. We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct No Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds No further questions. That was nice work today. The redirect on Howard. Where is he Damn. I have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to CourtMartial for professional misconduct. And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer. Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I'm your friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, I don't think your clients belong in jail. But I don't get to make that decision. I represent the Government of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a case. I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence. You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny. By everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway, shit, I practically dared you. Not for a second have you believed you could win. You got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer. Your boys are going down. I can't stop it anymore. Objection. Argumentative. Please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say. We object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness. Thank you judge. Object! please the court Lieutenant, don't answer that. Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red Lt. Kendrick, did you Thank you. Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks About how far by jeep Have you ever had to walk it And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 1620. But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 1645. If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 1645, then how could you be in your room at 1620 Private, did you ever actually hear Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red Why did you go into Santiago's room The witness has been read his rights, commander. Why did you go into Santiago's room Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it He did, didn't he Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red. Don't look at him. Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General CourtMartial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please. Objection. I'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information. Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular Your honor. Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future Judge Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies. Your honor Your Honor, these men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination. Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess to Object! Your Honor Judge Damnit Kaffee!! Guard the prisoner. Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent.

What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens... Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out... Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... SKETCH he photocopied They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright. I figured you share information. For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive. This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal. They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear. They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them. Who knows... maybe she's already given her parents a call, right Fuck. Any good You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.

PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER  Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the onehour photo... Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around... There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact... It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it... There were three men.  Two are obvious the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching... So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago... Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was.

I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... factcheck their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.

Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope. That's exactly what I am. You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh  And the guy who hired you, he has a hairlip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her. It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you. So, she didn't leave a note  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left She just seemed... depressed... What was she running from If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared. Why do you think he did it You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse I didn't mean to... I had to ask.  I apologize. Of course. I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow... You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey. Call him back and tell him I said so.  The goddamn thing's still under warranty. I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's hard. I've got a lead I have to follow through.  To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you.  I love you. We're all like that. No. I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though. It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye. Do you think the police did a good job It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something... If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place. Will you let me look You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know You were right. I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry Do you ever consider... do you realize that Mary may never come back It's been six years. Excuse me, I have to use your bathroom. Is this pretty much it Just... just videos Nothing. Yeah... guess so. Pardon me Well, it's tempting, but no thanks. I'll risk it. What are you reading Catchy title.

That's the beauty of lawyerclient privilege. Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.

Did he jerk off to it  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film I'm asking. Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered Enlighten me. No, I've got it.

261,POLITICIAN,8MM,0,False," None too discreet, is he He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.",26
262,MRS CHRISTIAN,8MM,0,False," Mister Welles. You're very prompt. I appreciate your coming on such short notice. This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney. Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone. Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here... I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places. You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality. As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. His inner sanctum. Not many people have been inside this room. Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary. We were married fortyfive years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply. Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles Just curious. My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is. There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize... Cash, stock certificates, and this... It's a film... of a girl being murdered. This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could. I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police... No. I'm telling you it's not that. Will you watch it and see for yourself I told you I can't, not yet. No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first... Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her. You've found missing persons before. I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her. My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits.  Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself... My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash. The checks were for odd amounts... One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars. To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash. Hello... Do you think the film could have cost that much Okay. You told me to look, so I looked. Hello How are you  Having any luck I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me Fine... How will I get it to you",771
263,LONGDALE,8MM,0,False," Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. You are a private investigator Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval. Let's get this over with. Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly. I was well compensated. Never mind how I found you. They're no friends of mine. None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers. Shut up. Shut your mouth and drive! You're making me very angry. You're asking me why A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain... Isn't it incredibly obvious Because he could.  He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for You've got four minutes till I call Mr. Velvet and let him know there's a problem. You almost went over your limit. Give me the film. Give me the film. He's lying. Stay away from me. Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now! Put it on the ground, kick it here... Move back!  All of you... move! Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now... I'm leaving. Stay where you are! Keep back! Our business is done, I'm leaving, no one's going to stop me...",326
264,DIRECTOR,8MM,0,False," What can I do for you, Mr. Welles Alright, Tom. There are reasons for the way we do things here. Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C. We do. Why don't they come to me I'm not so sure about this. I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me... Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. Excuse me... Tom, hold on... Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do. This is it.  It's not much.

You're like, a private detective I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV. No. She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes. I don't know. Yes. We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... It got to be too much for him. There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts. People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now This is her room. The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it. Those are for her birthday.  One for every year she's missed.  They'll be waiting for her when she comes back. Okay. We weren't religious.  We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids.  We never made her go to church.  But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious. Doesn't make much sense, does it When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church. Are you religious You should be. What There wasn't one.  The police looked. I don't know.  I think so. No.  You don't have any reason to think that... How... how can you say that to me... My husband never laid a hand on her.

There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs... In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT, crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES of PHOTOGRAPHS old photos of a wedding, of grandparents... Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath... Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out, opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE. He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray. Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY. Welles opens the DIARY, finds written Mary Anne Mathews.  Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about halffull of feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads... Yes. I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her. What am I supposed to do  Forget her  Time heals all wounds, right She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know. Hello... I remember.  You just left... What are you talking about... What... Who is this... Who are you No... No... no... no... Why... why are you doing this to me...",778

I know you and I haven't always gotten along sometimes, but please don't blame yourself.  There isn't anything you can do.  I'm going to make a whole new life in California. Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or in magazines.  Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne. Dear diary.  I have a big math test tomorrow.  I have to get better grades.  How come everybody does better than me  Kathy doesn't even study and she gets B's.  Two boys got in a fight after school today. One boy knocked the other boy's tooth out, at least that's what it looked like.  His nose and mouth were bleeding all over the place... ... We're reading The Great Gatsby in English class.  It's the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties and all his friends come around and party with him, but later when he dies nobody comes to his funeral.  Someone said there's a movie about it, but I looked in the video store and it wasn't there. Dear diary.  I started my first job last week working part time at Price Mart department store... ... The people I work with are all old and fat.  All they live for is their next coffee break so they can smoke... ... They eat lunch at the snack counter.  Hot dogs and soft pretzels.  Nachos with that orange cheese that comes out of a pump.  I don't know what I'd do if I'm still working there when I get old... ... I want to be a singer or an actress.  I know it's a stupid dream, but I know I can do it if I get a chance... ... Everyone's always telling me how pretty I am.  I don't think I am.  When I look in the mirror I wonder who they're talking about. Dear diary.  I went out with Bob today, the cute boy in my science class.  He took me to a movie... ... It was the middle of the day, but we held hands.  I think he likes me.  I really like him.  He has black hair and grey eyes... ... He opened the car door for me and paid for the movie.  When he took me home he said we should go out again soon.  I hope he calls... Dear diary.  Janet says she slept with her boyfriend.  I can't believe it.  She says they did it last weekend while her parents were out of town... ... She said she liked it, but she didn't seem too happy.  She didn't tell me many details.  She said he used a condom. Dear diary.  If I save enough money to go to community college maybe I can get good enough grades for a scholarship somewhere else... ... I've never been anywhere else. I don't think mom wants to let me go.  Every time I try to talk about it she says it'll cost too much or she changes the subject. Dear diary.  Something terrible happened today when dad and I were alone.  I can't tell anyone.  I feel sick.  What did I ever do to make this happen to me Dear diary.  My stomach hurts all the time.  I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.  I want to get out of my head and stop hearing myself think. Dear diary.  Grandma fell and broke her leg last week.  We drove down to visit her in the hospital. Hospitals smell like dead people. Dear diary.  It's happening all the time now.  There s nothing I can do. I'm all alone.  Everything is bad. I used to have lots of dreams and I'd remember them when I woke up, but that doesn't happen anymore. Dear diary.  If I can get to California, I'll be okay.  I've got money saved.  I can work as a waitress till I get something better.  Billy says he and his family went to California once on vacation.  He says it never rains. They stayed near the beach and he went swimming in the ocean... ... I hope I can be an actress.  I hope I can be happy.  I'll probably have to go to acting school.  I wish I knew someone who lived there. I'll miss my friends, but at least I'll be far away where no one can ever find me.

268,MAX,8MM,0,False," Big date tonight Can I interest you in a battery operatedvagina My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling. It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a batteryoperated vagina and you don't have one. Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.  Have a nice day. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is. Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be Adults Only,  She Male Films,  Amateur Sex Videos,  Women and  Watersports and Fisting  100's of Anal Films,  Asian Sex...  Came back for that batteryoperated vagina, right  Told you you would. Thomas Welles.  Nice picture. Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break. I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight. Three, four years. Max. There's not much illegal. You're not a cop, are you  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me. You're a private eye.  Like Shaft. From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here How much Four hundred a week, off the books. Sounds good, pops. Tomorrow night, I get off at eight. Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight. Come on. Fuck you, Larry. You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week .  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean  For the pornaddict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. There's two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the SM and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chickenhawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows  That's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. Twentyfive. I don't know, where are yours I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver  Go to Harvard  Run for President  What about you, pops I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of SM flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo. His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish. You're learning. Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money... Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a... He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art. I'm a working stiff, pops. You want me to come out there and play private eye See ya. You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. Great. Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag Dino Velvet. Wha... He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these. Why  He have something to do with whatever you're into I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself Machine, that's what they call him.  Machine. They say he's half braindead from all the steroids he's using. He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He loves what he does for a living. What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get. I know if I had to pick, it'd be Choke, or Devil. What's next Still don't want to tell me what you're doing What's this Look... that's awful generous and everything...",1290

He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing... So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so nonintrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage. Ah, ours guests have arrived.

What's going on Thanks. Hey. interrupting With grenadine, right Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun Carrying Swayzak's notebook Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. What was that Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II. What What's going on Yeah. Big fan. Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman. No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin. Every little boy's fantasy. I have a job. Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions like dying young. Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. Politics don't. C'mon Jennifer, he's just another NorthSide jagoff with a mouth. So now you suddenly care about my future Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them. You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here... So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what C'mon, let's crawl home. This Having fun, fireman What, are you kidding By myself What, is it the stairs Christ, I'll let you win next time. No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me. Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me! Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team... I waited... I would have fucking waited... Dad's way Where did he tell you that In a fucking seance You're right, Stephen... You win... You're the best, man... I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it. Yeah... Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant. Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere. I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. Where are you going Hey, do I know you What the hell are you talking about my What do you want me to do with What are you listening to Glass Another backdraft. No it couldn't. I mean you'd be right  with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug  industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here  but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot. In another life I was in highend electronics. Don't mention it. Hey, Tim. So, you surviving without me Swayzak's not my boss. Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh I would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know... Yeah Where Thanks for the insight. Just leave me alone, okay Uh, I don't think that's in my contract... Trychtichlorate is a binary structured During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium. Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder. And the putty around the door But the right guess on this is arson. Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case. Arson. Hey. Boss and I are up to about three words an hour. I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here. Yeah Well, maybe I can fit it in... Call ya back. Jesus! What But he killed these guys. What reason That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience Are you going public with this Hey... So are you dating your boss or what Sorry. Are you dating anyone Well, you did invite me here. Nice boat. Okay. No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one. Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked. In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah. Thanks for the invite. Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies. This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think See that trap door up there That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman. I wanted to be a good one. Old firehouse trick. Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. This is a six inch playpipe, cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows. item This is our pipe extender, used in forward lays... This is our hard suction line... Our adjustable insertion nozzle... trunk ...And this is the hose bed. Excuse us. Is he... Do they think he'll pull through I should have been there. You had to do it, didn't you Had to take on another fire bare handed, huh Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened Is it, Stephen He didn't listen He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him. You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points. Yeah And just how much of all this has been doing your job Leave Stephen out of this I work for the city. Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight. I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot. Backdraft Fire. Somewhere between zero and no way. Go talk to the building owner. Our book lists the owner as Dekom Trust. together in his mind Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb. So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants... Nice bunch of guys. Hi. Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden. You could check. It'd be in his files. Yes. Your boss is lying, Jennifer. Jennifer What is I'm sorry. You're right. Yeah Airtight I've got three different drafts of the same report  with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along. Then who wrote the report How ya feeling Did you pull me out Did I say thanks Just wondering. So what do you want me to do I'm close... but I can't get who it is... Who's doing this Then who I don't have a story. What I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... The outlets. Trychticholorate. Who the fuck is doing this Who's doing this Oh Jesus Christ... Oh goddamn it Stephen... Just... Just wanted to say hello... You're selling dad's boat I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do. Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other It's okay, Stephen, I I saw it. When dad died, I saw another fire... I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... Sometimes right when you're looking at them. Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people! How do you know What were they doing there What are we going to do about this We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen. Oh, Christ. Stephen...

Do yourself a favor and just walk away. That's Franny. She likes firemen. Gentlemen, please... As 17's official toastmaster Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to mention that you were cut out of my will I think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes  I mean probationary firemen  among us who today were baptized officially into the world of Old Man Fire. First to Tim, who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears, not only took on the beast but pulled from its clutches  assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter me  a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail. And to Brian, who's own contribution was both more beautiful and less likely to sue. Y'know, when I heard that both McCaffrey brothers were going to be assigned together here, well, my heart was filled with... a sudden desire to transfer. So raise a glass, lads. To funny looking Tim, and the McCaffrey brothers, who despite years of getting on each other's nerves have managed with great effort... to still be pissed off at each other. Gentlemen!

Hi. If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes... You think that's really any of your business Marty did. But I wanted you to come to. How's the job going Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.

But then I guess you haven't been to too many fires. You'll have an answer as soon as I do. You mean his firehouse closing program,  Don't you Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wannabees, well, I guess I can't say I sleep any less peacefully. ...So stop me if I get this wrong... The fire's almost out... You're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat. You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash Hey, I'm a hero. Heroes don't just stand around. So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline You could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence I use to prove it's arson. You've made my day longer, Probie. Go home and think about that. Your Dennis' kid. I work alone. Are you still here Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way. Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first Pest control. How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal. He works for me. You like everybody, Ronald. You don't know him. Knock it off. Now. Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald When you got bored, what did you do You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it Nobody cares, Ronald. Sure Ronald You're ready alright. Excuse me. What do you do with little girls What do you do with them, Ronald Huh And old ladies And the world  the whole world. See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go. Hey kid, c'mere  At least make yourself useful. Turn this over. Shhh. You sneaky little son of a bitch... Hide and seek... Come on, tell me what I want to know... recorder Heavy smoke stains observed in entry room. Demarkation line high. Fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off. It started somewhere else... Less soot here. More heat. And very little soot here. Get that couch out of the way. So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. Find me some glass. Do we have a language barrier here Glass. Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh What made you that mad Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air... Finish coat burned away... Severe spawling of rough coat... That's our ignition point. Dig it out. Carefully. Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire. Have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants. Check the wall for burn patterns. Putty On both doors McCaffrey, hold this for us. I just rewrote your contract. C'mere... Trychticholorate Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago. What the hell was it doing in the fire I asked you to hold him, not feel him up... Read. Go to the bottom. Under heat properties. Ever burned magnesium It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM! Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  unless you could find something that would eat its residue. Look, it isn't proof, okay Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes. Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier I don't guess. I don't work for them, either. Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it off. That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh Our killer doesn't love fire! I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much.  The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason. Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out. No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point. No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away. Goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of chemical traces and a behavioral link. Oh, and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest any time. Get your stuff and get out. Alderman. I usually have breakfast first. Don No Marty, I don't. We still haven't found a connection between the victims. Holcomb I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet. Is there a connection between them, Alderman What the hell are you doing here I thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange... And he's right. The backdraft was set somewhere in there. It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door. But the outer door held... and waited for Tim... So find me the fire. You're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost. In a word, Brian, what is this job all about It's a living thing, Brian. It breathes, it eats, and it hates. The only way to beat it is to think like it. To know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to. Some guys on this job, fire owns them. It makes them fight on its level. But the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like Ronald. We're the fire department, lady. You work here You seem real broken up about Mr. Holcomb. I still haven't gotten your fire report, Stevie. On Tim. I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it. What happened up there He was a candidate. Did he pay attention Was he listening What do you listen to, Stephen I might. I need that report, Lt. Son of a bitch. They knew each other. And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either. Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared. We need to get a look at his files. This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight. Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job  Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box. It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk. Hello Swayzak Uh... I sorta got a problem here... Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now... Yeah. No. I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless... I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place... In the Chicago Fire Department the alarm code 335 signifies that the company has returned home to quarters. We will now ring out that code to welcome home John Adcox and Stephen McCaffrey... Your brother was a good man. Another couple of good men get burned up for their city Is that how it's going to read You're the only one that knows. Want to help me with something Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin' This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this This is just a guess of course, but I think they're gonna want to know why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to create a phony manpower study. You guys'll wait, right Brian. Don't keep looking over your shoulder for the ghost. It's gone now.",1779
