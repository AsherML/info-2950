    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research project seeks to investigate the role that villains play in classical-style mystery \"whodunit\" movies throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. While their existence and importance within this genre are without debate, there hasn't been much analysis regarding the structural role they play in these movies, how they differ from other characters besides \"they get caught in the end\", or how they might share similar characteristics even across movies. Specifically, we desire to explore the three questions below: \n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the time period during which the movie was released have an impact on how villains in archetypally typical mystery movies are portrayed (how they speak and act)? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Do villains have patterns of speech or content they bring up that are noticably different from other characters in their films? (for example: Do patterns of word/phrase usage emerge? Are villains routinely portraying a certain sentiment or showing feelings of guilt?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a combination of both of those questions, how do the two aspects discussed here interact with each other? Do the patterns of villain behavior identified in movies change over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do villains more closely resemble villains from other movies or their supporting cast in the same movie. In other words, is there something unique about villains that overcomes the stylistic similarity to other characters in their movies.\n"

    "Our raw text files existed scattered across a series of folders delineated by genre (examples included \"Crime\", \"Action\", \"Comedy\", etc.). In order to just work with the movies which met our \"classical mystery\" classification, we grouped all the movies we'd identified into a separate \"Using\" folder. At this point we had our movie scripts and our movie metadata files, which are stored in the drama_movies, crime_movies, and thriller_movies python files. These metadata files are an intermediate stage, but they're desribed in more detail in the dataset creation section. We then took the below steps in order to turn those text files into a workable dataset. "

    "While the above code works for most script formats, occassionally formatting errors in the script itself can result in errors. Additionally often the same character will be referred to by different names in a script. For example, in a single movie dialogue spoken by the character Harry Wilkens might be labelled as Harry, Mr. Wilkens, Harry's Voice, or any other permutations. Additionally, while the original researchers claimed to have removed setting description and camera directions from the scripts, they did not do so entirely. These often appear in the same format in the script as calls for new characters, causing countless errors. These two convenience functions below serve to elimniate these errors. The first deals with the issue of character permutations, allowing us to combine all the dialogue said by two characters and then deleting the extras from the list. The second is more simple, and is used to flat-out remove entries that were not characters but were added in error."

The corpus was originally designed to serve as a general purpose dataset for researchers interested in natural language problems involving dialogue and conversation. This corpus consisted of 862 film scripts downloaded from the internet movie scripts database (imsdb.com) separated by the genre they were labeled as. Ostensibly, there was minimum cleaning performed on the datasets to isolate dialogue, but this cleaning process wasn’t particularly consistent as some scripts included scene descriptions, camera instructions such as “CUT TO” or “FADE TO”, blocking, or non-spoken character actions.

We removed these from the dataset since they don't actually describe what the character says, merely how they're being shown by the camera. The second type of error was when the same character is referred to in multiple ways. One example was when lines spoken by the character Lee Blanchard in Black Dahlia were attributed to either \"Lee Blanchard\", \"Lee\", or \"Lee's voice\". We corrected these errors by amalgamating all lines into the most informative character name (in this case Lee Blanchard) and then removing the duplicated.

This could be a representation concern if we were to be using this data to be representative of all films, but given that we are only discussing that one subset of mystery movies, This limiting aspect of our data should also be okay. The results we get could be vaguely generalizing for people who watch this particular sub genre of film, but if they are wary of our sample size then hopefully it should be alright. \n",

This skew could make it seem as though villains have a similar tone to regular characters in one movie, when in reality, the characters all have similar tones because they all live in the same town and have experienced similar things. \n"

    "Here we can see that we have 271 characters across the movies who fit our criteria. Each character had just over 1500 words to speak over the course of the movie, and the most common emotions for them were trust and anticipation (negativity and positivity are excluded because they are for sentiment analysis instead of emotion analysis). Anticipation was expected, as much of the premise of a mystery movie is its ability to build suspense in the viewer over the course of the movie until the criminal is revealed. However, trustworthiness is surprising, one would expect that in a movie about trying to eliminate suspects there wouldn't be overwhelming feelings of goodwill and trust between characters. "

    "Surprisingly, villain status does not seem to be correlated with the sentiments a character espouses over the course of the movie. This is surprising, as one often thinks of villains and psychopaths as qualitatively different from other people largely based on their ability to process and express emotion. If a characters \"emotional score\" is completely unrelated to their ability to commit the types of horrendous acts that are so typical of this genre, then that may suggest that either writers aren't doing a very good job portraying these types of characters or that villains and psychopaths may be much better at concealing their inner thoughts than most people realize. This is further confounded by the fact that though the correlations are all small, they're highest for the positivity sentiment and the joy emotion, with their correlations almost doubling the next nearest. One might have expected emotions such as disgust or negativity to be expressed by those defined by their ability to act in ways that are disgusting and negative, but these otherwise happy characteristics suggest a hidden side to their portrayal in media."
