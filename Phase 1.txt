Questions for Research Mentor:
1. Are we allowed/encouraged to use multiple data sets, or is the project really meant to focus on just one. 
2. Do you think one of these datasets seems particularily set to this project?
3. Is there an easy way to send models between computers on github without having to reprocess on each partner's computer?
