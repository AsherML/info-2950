0,MACREEDY,Bad Day at Black Rock,1995,False,"I'll only be here twentyfour hours. That's right. grin They didn't Probably didn't think it was important. I want to go to Adobe Flat. Any cabs available Where's the hotel I asked where's the hotel Thanks. 'Afternoon. You run this hotel Then there's nothing you can do for me. I'd like a room. Got any idea where I might I thought it ended a couple of months ago. Tell me. ledger You seem to have lots of vacancies. Lots of vacancies. Yes... Not really. But while I'm pondering it, get a room ready. Just for tonight. rack at random This one. Sure could use a bath. Where is it I don't know just why you're interested  but the name's Macreedy. I'm... It's all in the ledger. I think you have the wrong room. Nothing, I guess. And this, I guess, is yours I guess I do. Would you mind very much if I sort of... his suitcase and clothing ...clean up this mess and get another room I guess so. I guess not. One thing I know. Since I got off the train, I've been needled. Why Hey! Hold it! Got any cigarettes In my new room, you mean I'm staying. Just about twentyfour hours. Why Why You expecting a convention Stale. Where can I rent a car Let's put it this way  if I had a car and if I wanted to put gas in it, where would I go Thanks. Coley Here we go again. Hi, T.J. This your garage T.J. Nope. Where's the man it belongs to T.J. Ain't a man. T.J. Lady runs this garage. T.J. She's not here. Where'd she go T.J. I dunno. Somewhere. When will she be back T.J. I dunno. Sometime. T.J. In about ten minutes. Thanks. Sorry. I thought you were a guest. No, thanks. You tell me. What were you celebrating My name's Macreedy. I came in on the Streamliner. I said I came in... No. as to a child All I want from you is a little information. I've got to get to a place called Adobe Flat. One thing about Black Rock everybody's polite. Makes for gracious living. How do you know door, with a rueful grin I'm looking for a man named Komako. Almost a disaster. What about Komako That's the friendliest word I've heard since I got here. They act like they're sitting on a keg. I don't know. Maybe diamonds. Maybe gunpowder. I thought the tradition of the old West was hospitality. Could be. Thanks, but I'm afraid not. I'm looking for... Never mind. Thanks, anyway. A man named Komako. No Which one did he go to You think maybe if I wrote him, the letter would be forwarded It wouldn't be too much trouble Funny. Because I think it would be a great deal of trouble for you. It's been a great deal of trouble for me. I wrote these letters to Komako. They weren't forwarded. They were returned  address unknown. Smith So I guess there's nothing you can do for me, after all. Need a little help Well, I need a little help. questioningly I'd like to rent your jeep. The road's marked Then I won't need your time. I can manage. It's all right. I won't mention it to the Sheriff. Yeah. It's a small world. I'm kind of sorry if I've incurred your displeasure. If there's anything I can do to make up for it... I'd be glad to pay the damages. Fortunately no one was hurt. That's the real danger, I can see that. I'm getting out of here, right now. Still expecting that convention If you're expecting any extra cowboys, my room is available. Is there a train through here tonight I know that. How about freights Milk train Busses I'm inclined to agree with you. Anybody home In that case, where do you suggest I look It was, just a few hours ago. Sure. And Smith is the kid who changes 'em. Miss Brooks. What's the matter with this town of yours Then why are they all so concerned about me No, you're not. But... But it strikes me you're a little too unconcerned. So unconcerned you won't even rent me a jeep. I wish others in this town were as scrupulously devoted to law and order as you are. Funny thing. They try to kill me, and you feel persecuted. Involved in what All of them Dead and buried Whatever did happen, you don't seem to like it. Why do you stick around Didn't you ever think of going without him. You're sort of independent and he's... he's... What did your brother do Nothing much. Only, there're not many places like this in America but even one is too many. Because I think something sort of bad happened here. Something I can't find the handle to... This much I know  the rule of law has been suspended in this town. The gorillas have taken over. I kind of had a notion that was the only way I could get it. Was I wrong, Miss Brooks I'm around all right. wryness You probably know that Miss Brooks is no longer in the car rental business You wouldn't Sure. I admire your sturdy sense of responsibility. Let's talk about my future. I don't seem to be going any place. I have a way with jeeps. A certain familiarity. Italy. What stopped you Tough. I'm retired. You might say I was forced into retirement. Komako, like I told you. Like you told me, he wasn't there. What's so funny Flattery will get you nowhere. Maybe I'm not so big. What makes you mad, Mr. Smith I see. You're a big man, too. Only... ...the Japanese make you mad... ...and Komako made you mad. What did Komako have to do with Corregidor All strangers do. Snooping for what For what Leave you alone to do what What happened to Komako Nothing. Only  I don't believe you. Any more than I believed you about the letters. Yes, I do  about businessmen, for instance. I think a businessman would be interested in Adobe Flat. All that land lying fallow. Could be put to some use. Like a graveyard. to speak but Macreedy goes on A historian might be interested, too. Because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle... Something's buried out there. See these wild flowers That means a grave. I've seen it overseas. I figure it isn't a man's grave or someone would have marked it. Sort of a mystery, isn't it Maybe. Not interested. I got other things to do. Can I use your phone What's 424 Thanks. 424. grimacing Don't look at me like that. Like I'm a potential customer. Yeah. I've got a problem of my own. And you'll just sit on your hands and let them. Sorry. To save a life. It's a little late for that... How can I Where is it dashboard Won't start. Just won't start... For that I thank you. How much time you think I've got before... shoulder lightly Well, so long, Doc. I can't say it's been charming but... I don't know. But I'm going on foot. It can be fixed. Maybe... If I can't get out of town, maybe I can get the state cops in. There's another way. I'll be seeing you, Doc. the counter That's what it says. I never thought much about it. What ails you, Mr. Hastings Why are you so upset about... ...this wire Are you afraid, Mr. Hastings You want me to describe the symptoms Right this minute I'm scared half to death. Yeah. But not of the state police. Then what are you afraid of The grave at Adobe Flat A grave nobody marked, nobody knows anything about. Is it Smith Is it! To Smith you are. How about to Komako bill toward Hastings Then send that wire, and bring me the answer. You'll do that, won't you What have you got Anything else In that case, I'll have it. And a cup of coffee. Going to, or coming from No comment. I always seem to be taking somebody's place around here. I was afraid of that. Suppose you tell me where to sit. toward Coley Your friend's a very ... fellow. No comment. You're not only wrong  you're wrong at the top of your voice. Smith I think your friend's trying to start something. I don't know. Maybe he figures, needle me enough and I'll crack. Maybe I'll even fight back. Then he or Hector your other ape  would beat me to death and cop a plea of selfdefense. Wouldn't it be easier if you just waited till I turned my back loafers at the bar, then back at Smith Or are there too many witnesses present So are you. Whatever happens  you're lost. You killed Komako. Sooner or later you'll go up for it. Not because you killed him  in this town you probably could have gotten away with it  but because you didn't even have the guts to do it alone. You put your trust in guys like him... unconscious Coley ...and Hector  they're not the most dependable of God's creatures. Sooner or later they'll get the idea you're playing them for saps. What'll you do then  peel them off, one by one And in the meantime if any one of them breaks, you'll go down hard. Because they got something on you. Something to use when things get tough. And they're getting tougher every minute. Anything for me Any message  a telegram I'm waiting for a wire. From the state cops. door No I think that's for me. from Smith's hand and quickly glances at it. Looking up at Hastings Where's the answer Nothing. Just a thought Hastings. Hastings wilts a thought dazzling in its purity... You're in a jam, Hastings. You gave my telegram to Smith. You're in deep, too. Like I said, it's getting tougher and tougher. Sheriff, you'd better do something about this. I know right arm strays to massage the paralyzed left pain is bewildering. I came here bewildered, full of selfpity, afraid to fight back. hand to Pete And then your friend Smith tried to kill me. Pete's mouth tighten Funny, how a man clings to the earth when he feels there's a chance he may never see it again. him You think so I was washed up when I got off that train... Had to. I had one last duty to perform before I resigned from the human race. L.A.'s a good jumping off place for the Islands, for Mexico, Central America. I don't know. I was looking for a place to get lost, I guess. arm with the whisky bottle Because of this. I thought I'd never be able to function again. Thanks to your friend Smith, I found I was wrong. I know your problem. You'd like me to die quickly, without wasting too much of your time... to say something, but Macreedy presses on ...or silently, without making you feel too uncomfortable... or thankfully, without making your memories of the occasion too unpleasant. advantage What happened, Pete I know. To enlist. He was turned down. Ten o'clock in the morning. Did you know him Then you all got scared, buried him, kept quiet. Did Komako have any family besides his son Joe He had one. But he's dead, too. He's buried in Italy. Joe Komako died in Italy, saving my life. They gave him a medal. I came here to give it to his father. guttural It'll take a lot of whiskey to wash out your guts... ...And it will never help  not even a barrel full washes away murder! But maybe I'm wrong. Go on  drink. What else is left for you! You're as dead as Komako, only you don't know it! You also don't know that it's not enough to feel guilty. It's not enough to confess. It's not enough to say, Forgive me, I've done wrong. Sit down! Or would you rather have me kneel, to beg his pardon for raising a touchy subject Well, that's mighty noble of you. You feel ashamed  that's noble, too. And four years from now you'll probably be sitting here telling somebody else you haven't forgotten me. That's progress  you'll still be ashamed but I'll be dead. Go on, have your drink. You need it. Thanks, Pete. Thanks very much. I'll never forgive you, Doc... Hector, out cold ...for depriving me of that pleasure. QUICK DISSOLVE You're doing the best you can. Aren't you, Liz Don't worry, I won't. Yes I do. That I don't believe. It's never too late. Why is muscle so important Not with muscle. I'm beginning' to think it runs in the family. You think strength is in the width of a man's shoulders. He wasn't around when I left... Maybe I will yet. What's this teeth You're stupid, Liz. You're a fool. If he finishes me, he's got to finish you. I'd like to kill you now, but you caused too much pain to die quickly. You'll be tried in a court of law. You'll be convicted by a jury. Then you'll die. DISSOLVE Smith off the fender with his rifle Hands behind your head. Am I going to have trouble with you Just as you took care of his buddies Well. The gang is all here. toward Smith Put him in with Hastings. Your sister's outside, Pete. She's dead. DISSOLVE beat, to Doc Tim knows where to find me if I'm needed. What's on your mind, Doc We... Can who have it Why Some towns come back. Some don't. It depends on the people. A shooting. Second time.

You might try the garage at the end of the street. Nothing. I was just wondering what all you people were worrying about. coldly Not that I have the slightest idea. I hold no truck with silence. I got nothing to hide. Nothing, man. It's just, you worry about the stranger only if you look at him... ...from a certain aspect. With the innocence of a freshlaid egg. Hey! Now what do you know Mr. Macreedy seems to be heading for the jail. Now what do you suppose he'd want to see the Sheriff about I don't laugh, Tim. Cut it out, Tim. In the name of welladjusted manhood, snap out of it. You're going to get a complex or something. What could you have found out They told you a story. You had to believe it. I don't know. I lead a quiet, contemplative life. I don't know. I've never been able to find one for myself. Only one thing  don't quit, Tim. Maybe this feller Macreedy has the prescription. DISSOLVE Hi. Pull up a chair. Help yourself. You know, you're one of the few people who's ever been back here I can say that to. It's 424. If I've got you pegged  and I think I have  you're calling the State Police. But if I was you  and I'm purely glad I'm not  I'd look it up myself. I wouldn't trust anybody around here, including me. I know  don't tell me  lines all busy. They'll be busy all day. Like what Everybody is  and I get 'em coming and going. First I sell 'em a piece of land. Think they farm it Nope. They dig for gold. They rip off the top soil of ten winding hills. They sprint in here, fogheaved with excitement, lugging nuggets, big and bright and shiny. Is it gold It is not! Do they quit They do not! gesture toward reproduction Then they decide to farm. Farm! In country so dry you have to prime a man before he can spit, and before you can say Fat Sam they're stalled, stranded and starving. They get weevil brained and buttsprung... So I bury 'em. Macreedy in the center of the room But why should I bore you with my triumphs prophet They're going to kill you with no hard feelings. Don't get waspish with me, young feller. I feel for you, but I'm consumed with apathy. Why should I mix in I got enough trouble saving my own. from a milk bottle on the desk I try to live right and drink my orange juice every day. But mostly I try to mind my own business. Which is something I'd advise you to do. You can still get out of town. And you'd better get out like a whisper. from his pocket I got sort of a limousine at your disposal. Out back. Something wrong They'll wait at least till dark. They'd be afraid to see each other's faces. Where are you going That's no good. You stray ten yards off Main Street, and you'll be stone, cold dead. cigarette That's the situation, in a nut. turning on Hector Do the nice little things, like keep your big fat nose out of my business.

QUICK DISSOLVE gruffly In case you're interested, Coley'll live. Hector I'm truly sorry to say. Yeah. He's wicked. He defends himself when he's attacked. Well... You going to just sit here and let time run out You sent it through Hastings Just don't expect an answer, if that's the way you sent it. You warty wretch! That's a federal offense! You can't do that! It's all right, Tim. We're not licked yet. There comes a time, Tim, when a man's just got to do something. No man is useless, if he's got a friend... I'm your friend, Tim. with a thumb He's going to need you before the night is over. And all the useful men are on the other side. I can't let you alone! I can't let myself alone! Don't you understand that Pete, who is unable to shake his gaze. Then, sadly, fiercely Four years ago something terrible happened here. We did nothing about it. Nothing. The whole town fell into a sort of settled melancholy, and the people in it closed their eyes and held their tongues and failed the test with a whimper. Now something terrible is going to happen again, and in a way we're lucky because we've been given a second chance. And this time I won't close my eyes, I won't hold my tongue, and if I'm needed I won't fail. facing Tim And neither will you! There's a difference between clinging to the earth... contemptuously ...and crawling on it. You going to stand by and watch forever Pete There's too many smart guys around here. I'm glad I'm a dummy.

He leased it to Komako  thought he had cheated him, thought Komako could never even run stock without water. There was never any water on Adobe Flat. Komako dug a well, by hand.

You're looking for what, Mr. Macreedy Komako  Sure, I remember him Japanese farmer. Never had a chance. He got here in '41  just before Pearl Harbor. Three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers. Tough. Who knows I'm sure it would. Write your letter. I'll see it gets out tonight. No trouble at all. Aren't you going to ask him where he wants to go He wants to go to Adobe Flat. Liz. Do you have a license to rent cars You could get into trouble. You shouldn't have done that. This is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life. QUICK DISSOLVE disinterestedly What did he want  the stranger A storm About what Trouble You don't know anything about Komako, now do you, Tim The point is, what you don't know can't hurt you. Tim, you're a lost ball in the high weeds. I told you a long time ago, nothing happened for you to worry about. Then do your job, Tim. Macreedy'll do nothing, Tim. And neither will you. That would be dangerous. You got the body of a hippo, Tim, but the brain of a rabbit. Don't overtax it. Shut up! Now, Coley... Is he Isn't there You got brains, you have. A nobody like Macreedy can raise a pretty big stink. The point is... who would miss a nobody like Macreedy if he just, say, disappeared Who, Coley Coley! Wait for what Not Macreedy. I know those maimed guys. Their minds get twisted. They put on hair shirts and act like martyrs. They're all of 'em do gooders, trouble makers, freaks. appealing to Coley as an equal No danger, he says. This guy's like a carrier of small pox. Since he arrives, there's been a fever in this town, an infection. And it's spreading. to Pete Hastings has been in a sick sweat, running around, shooting off his face. Doc, for the first time in four years, gets snotty with me. Liz... ...your own sister  acts like a fool. Kid! She must have strained every muscle in her head to get so stupid! Renting him a jeep! And Tim  Tim, the rumdum. Tim suddenly decides he's gotta act like a Sheriff. at Pete And he says what's the danger. Of course, if you want to take the chance... All right, then... surprise Well, listen to little spitfire... Pete You sniveling toad! I'm saving your neck! If I don't, who will Who will! Doc Tim Your sister, with the rocks in her head One thing about your sister  she's got twice the guts you have. You're only fit for running away. All right, then... Mr. Macreedy. Macreedy turns toward him I'd like to ask you a few questions... as long as you're around... Good. I wouldn't want to see that girl get into trouble... ...what with rental permits, gas rationing... you know what I mean. It's just, a girl like that has a future. Do you have the time I hear you handle a jeep real well. I think I understand. You're an Army man. stiff arm Where'd you get it Tough. I tried to get in myself, the day after those rats bombed Pearl Harbor. The physical. They wouldn't take me. The morning after Pearl, I was the first man in line at Marine recruiting in Sand City. And they wouldn't take me. What do you do in Los Angeles, Mr. Macreedy You're a pretty young man... What were you looking for in Adobe Flat Nothing. It's just  I don't believe you. I believe a man is as big as what he seeks. I believe you're a big man, Mr. Macreedy. Why would a man like you be looking for a lousy Jap farmer Yes, you are. at Macreedy I believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad. Nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad. Me... Nothing in particular. That's different. After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor... after Bataan... It's the same thing. Loyal JapaneseAmericans  that's a laugh. They're mad dogs. Look at Corregidor, the death march. Wasn't he a Jap Look, Macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs. But if I see a mad dog loose, I don't wait for him to bite me. shaking his head with irritation I swear, you're beginning to make me mad. Not all. Some of 'em. When they come here snooping. I mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something. I don't know. People are always looking for something in this part of the West. To the historian, it's the Old West. To the book writers, it's the Wild West. To the businessmen, it's the Undeveloped West. They all say we're backward and poor, and I guess we are. We don't even have enough water. But this place, to us, is our West. I just wish they'd leave us alone. I don't know what you mean. He went away, I told you. Shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place. They burned it down. It was one of those things  you know how kids are. What's funny You don't seem to believe anything I say. Why Burying cattle... Sort of. Maybe you can figure it out. Why not give it a whirl It'll help you pass the time... meaningfully ...for a while. He's as changeable as a prairie fire. Sort of unpredictable, too. Got a temper like a rattlesnake. Now whyever would he want to do that I don't think that'll be necessary. You're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat. ferocity You're still in trouble. You got things a bit twisted... You expect an answer  to a wire that's never sent What's so funny Tim, you're pathetic. That's the point. You're not Sheriff any more. You just lost a job, you're so pathetic. All right, Sheriff. Take over. Can't I I put him in office. Now I take him out. Hector... Come on, Hector. Just a few more steps, honey. First things first, honey. You were going to help me, Liz. quizzically I still need your help. You two started out in a car. That's the way you'll end up. Over a cliff, burning. him, but he goes on... You can blame that on Macreedy, too. He said I had too many witnesses. I got to start with somebody. Go ahead  kill me.

6,BUCKY,Black Dahlia,2006,False,"You come all the way down here to roust Impressive. Whatta we do about the Mex You'll take him. He's all yours. And I'm not your partner. Somethin' up, Tommy His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick. Before the war, the City of the Angels was graced with two local fighters, born and raised a scant five miles apart, pugilists with styles as different as fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each other, but a sense of duty brought them together in spirit, and both joined the Los Angeles Police Department. Blanchard cracked the baffling BoulevardCitizens bank robbery case in 1939 and captured thrillkiller Tomas Dos Santos Bleichert served with distinction during the '43 Zoot Suit Wars Both men made great sacrifices to serve their city, and on Election Day, voters are going to be asked to do the same thingvote on a five million dollar bond proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment and provide for an eight percent pay raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote Yes on Proposition B. Subtle. I'm in. Uh, yes sir. Hello. I always won. You a fight fan I'll try not to hurt you. He's got money on me, I gather And if I win I get Warrants What do you think of all this, Miss Lake Luck short of winning. Papa Speak English, papa. Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me how you can fuck this place up so bad in one month. Speak...English. Papa, please. ...He's had another stroke. If you could just come by and clean the place up and keep an eye on him for week or so...a hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten days. I promise. I do. Thank you. I'm not bettin' on me, Pete. Knockout between rounds eight and ten. Thanks, Pete. Short of winning Where's your sketch pad Education's an expensive habit to kick. He shouldn't have quit fighting. Saving myself for Rita Hayworth. Quits fighting for you. Puts you through school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair. Why not Shacking's against the regs. Probably cost him a stripe. You didn't answer my question He'll catch on soon enough. Gettin' there. What But I lost. Loew's deal The proposition passed, sir. Why'd you really quit fighting One more. What are we doin' here Right there! Police officer. You're under arrest. Play nice.

Nash is renting a room in that building over there. No. This isn't him. Hey. Junior Nash, remember No. He beat an old woman to death. That's why he's our priority warrantee.

We'd like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter. When was the last time you saw your daughter Was that soldier her boyfriend Any names, Mr. Short Flip to see who writes it up She's a smart woman. How'd you know it was me Lee's No need for that.

How about you sit dawn and answer my questions or I bust you for the reefer you flushed. First question. Does a... Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live here She moved around quite a bit. You know why Was somebody threatening her I've gathered that. Let's change the subject. How about movies You girls are all tryin' to break in, right Congratulations. What about Betty ...stretch the truth Your ride's here This'll just take a minute. I'll handle 'em Sarge I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if Betty ever engaged in prostitution... Did she ever tell you she was in a movie Sometime around November Did she say what it was Do you remember the names of any of the guys What is it You can tell me. Linda Martin Are you saying the woman was a lesbian Take their statements, Bill. I've got a little more here. Linda Martin's room Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska. Runaway. When'd you see her last You couldn't have known. No shit Sherlock. Administrative Vice Squad LAPD Homicide. Seen either of 'em You tell me. Capice when your girls tell me that. Black Dahlia. What about this girl Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's fifteen fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on you, and you spend the next five years servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in Tehachapi. Welcome back to earth, partner. Your fault for buying her all those chemistry classes. No. Thanks. You send me back to Warrants Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched. All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial. And a grandstanding son of a bitch. What are you gonna do Oh Jesus. She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least three misdemeanors here. It's out of control I promised him a week on it. Four more days and it's over. Slumming, Miss Sprague I'm a policeman. Homicide. Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin. Here or downtown I know you knew her so don't jerk me off on that or it's downtown and a whole lot of publicity. You sleep with either of them Are you lez Why'd you rabbit last night In Technicolor. beat What did you talk about Betty ever tell you about a movie she did Show you a viewfinder Anything specific You're cute. That's all anyone ever wants to volunteer the alibi. Go ahead. I don't need your cash if that's what you're saying. Convince me. I know the address. Bucky Bleichert. So...You smooth things with Kay De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it Lee Bleichert. Homicide. Sure. A pleasure, Mr. Sprague. Thanks. Died of a heroin overdose. German. Very realistic. So when did you come here I always loved the Keystone Kops. No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't. I grew up there. Not them, me. Do me. Be with me. Well. I think you kept your name out of the papers. Your mother would love that. How You don't have to tell me this I like you, too. Jesus What is it And that's all of it Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty cops out there combing every bar in town looking for Dahlia info. You could be headed for the papers no matter what. You don't mean that. Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet Betty Short How do you mean I wouldn't know. You made the casting rounds together. Ever get any movie work So what about the film can A dirty movie Was this around Thanksgiving Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder Did he seem particularly interested in Betty Did she see him again But you saw him again, didn't you How else could you have gotten a copy I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day. Yeah. I did, partner. I did. Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short Yes, sir. It's me. You want to get together I'll pick you up in fortyfive minutes. I have an apartment, you know. No. And I checked through the case file. There's no mention of that noteleaving number you pulled. beat Babe, I'm withholding evidence for you. It's a fair trade for what I'm getting, but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven't told me about Betty and Linda Jesus Christ. Blanchard! Not good enough. Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee He's in trouble, you know. De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over to stay with you. Kay. Lee Short of winning Thank you very much. What happened in TJ That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer Tijuana. Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt. Finish up with you and Blanchard. How long He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it. Kay He's coming back. Lee. I wasn't on the transfer list. Why No. I heard that, too. They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he doesn't show up in thirty days he's out. Like the guy who killed the Dahlia Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires. What do you want, Ellis Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd you kill her Come clean, pop. Tell me about it, Cecil. One more time, shitbird. Tell me about you and Betty Short. I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in mind. Convince me. You're a pimp. You know Betty Short Why'd you confess to her murder You feel guilty Charlie You hit your girls, get 'em high on hop You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as Liz Anyone at all Issler did. You know what else he said Fritzie didn't give a damn about those other three. It was all about Issler. Never occurred to me before. Meet me back here. Late. Hello, Charlie. Get lost I want him nailed. Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know about... I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of her phantom servicemen boyfriends ...had drinks with a great girl, Sally Stinson, who thinks she way be able to help me get a job cocktailing... Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick with me...What next, padre I want him. Hello You'd hooked with her before She do dyke Any porn Did anything unusual happen Did Vogel say anything about Liz Was he gonna see her again Anything Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses One last time to be sure. You are sure this is the man that you tricked with And tricked with Liz Short But you said There. Johnny Elizabeth Short, shitbird. Elizabeth fucking Short! I owe her this one. No comment...No comment... Tell your Daddy I know everything. Including his extortion deal. Tell him I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow. I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is Officer John Vogel. Book him. Why Kay. First thing. This man's LAPD. He's been missing in Mexico since January. He was last seen headed here. At least. I have two partners waiting for me in Tijuana. If you don't mind I'll check back in the morning. Blanchard You've seen him When Is he still in town I'm looking to get him out of a shitload of trouble. Thank you. Ernie. I need to see Ernie. I heard this man gave you some trouble a while back. He's my best friend. What happened That's it You tell me all of it and you watch what you say about my partner, or it's a BE roust and the Ensenada jail. Does he know I'm staying here So. Let's hear it. What's her name Go on. Go on. Prove it to me. Prove it! You got a shovel Good enough. What Sure, babe. Hello...Hey Vic... Gotta go. Workup on a probable gunshot suicide. Hancock Park. I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs. Like their mother. How old are they Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia... Mrs. Chambers Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha Sprague The next block over I did a little work for them once. How do you mean Bucky. Goodbye, Jane. Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband Wonder how he made it Oh really I'm...looking for the hammer. Were you ever going to tell me Were you ever going to tell me Ever. Were you ever... Who was the driver, Kay Tell me. Tell me! You're not that old. And you're not very widowed. You seem to be doing all right. Little over a year. So how well do you know the Spragues Your husband sounds like a good man. I read an article in the paper. Maybe your husband It's not so strange. I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue. I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine Jane. Don't be catty. God that is spooky. No thanks. And you mine. It's me. Nothing. I thought the family came back from Laguna this week. Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories Hey! Goddammit! Get back here! Babe Babe. Goddammit. Wait You didn't move far. Tighter'n a popcorn fart. I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said... My father. She killed herself a long time ago. Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's just... I want to search every fucking inch of every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague property if it takes the rest of my shitty career. And I know exactly where we start. Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that lantern. Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's another set of latents up there on the doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad I can't transfer 'em. We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of her. All right here. No. Thanks. I'll stay here. I want to get up early and confirm these prints. That night I pictured myself the way I wanted Elizabeth to picture meher knight in shining armor, a reborn twobit harness bull who cracked the biggest unsolved homicide in California history. A war hero, a heavyweight champion. I stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at all. Because there was no way for me to make the arrest without admitting that I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The case would always be open. And so while it killed me to wait 'til morning, in some ways...this was our last night together. And what is that, Emmett Saps like me Direct line to the straight dope Or is that what you needed George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and the two of you covered it up. You helped Linda Martin and Betty make that stag film. Where was the set In one of Daddy's old buildings Of course. She looked like his daughter. He fucked your wife. But I don't think you cared about that. But he's her daddy. And that must have made you crazy. He was a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't think he was disfigured in a car wreck. How'd it all go down So many pretty things here... He was a sick fuck and you knew it! What did you tell Betty What did you tell her Then Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake. And then what I come along Daddy tell you to fuck me or was that your idea The whole family have a good laugh at dinner that night Pumping me for info about the case Throwing me Georgie stories to see if I'd bite A little hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't check out your alibi What about sweet little Martha Martha tell you this Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's. Passports. All four. I need to see it. Just to be sure. I need to see it. I need to see his grave, you tightass kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you bury George Tilden Yeah, well. Old habits die hard. Yes, I'm fine. Where'd Eldridge get the painting I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you. So tell me. Let me see. Tell me about Betty Short. Your husband bought her for George. For George You tortured her. She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat. How much of the hundred grand did Lee let you keep He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew about Laverne's Hideaway. He blackmailed Sprague And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He took that hundred thousand and split to Mexico and you let him go! He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business with the lady. I've been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. But I haven't had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya think Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short to the very end, eh It's not as good as yours, I'll admit. But then again you've got an ear for accents. Accents, dressing up in costumes... Do another one for me. Play someone else. Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do another. How 'bout the Mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let's see the makeup job. Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased after poor daddy's money. Tell me somethingyou shoot Lee yourself Did you at least have the guts to shoot him yourself",3125,"[come, way, roust, Impressive, Whatta, Mex, partner, Somethin', Tommy, old, man, Fritzie, Central,

7,KAY,Black Dahlia,2006,False,"Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme art classes so I'd sketch the boxers. For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets ridiculed for perpetrating this farce. For financial reasons I hope Lee wins. And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both look good with your shirts off. Luck, Dwight. At least he looks good with his shirt off. I was never very good. Ended up with a degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight money paid for it. I asked him to. Besides, catching animals gave him a sense of order. You have a girlfriend, Dwight We're not getting married if that's what you're wondering. I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow night. Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight. Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it. Then you've never really had to. Lucky man. beat Lee! Dinner! To fairy tales! Oh baby. Oh babe. Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight. We're on edge. He swore at the trial he was going to kill Lee. Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby. Hi, Dwight. Lee stomps, you tread lightly. Let me guess...Lee's up all night probably on Benzedrine againworking that poor girl's murder You're worried about him. And he's worried about me. But who's worried about you Is that left for me For such a cautious man you're quite a hardcase. Good night. Hi, Dwight. Lee, Dwight's here. This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but I'll give you a theory if you'll eat something to calm yourself down. Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were two killers. Because the torture cuts are crude, while the bisection and the cut on the abdomen are neat and clean... It's sick and it's insane! After everything...And all that might happen Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes. We're famous, Dwight. I haven't seen him since you beat him up. I don't blame you. I don't want you coming over here just to sleep an the couch again. You know Dwight Fighting, cops, guns. To most peoplethat's the scary stuff. Not everything else. Luck. Luck. I spent the morning with Internal Affairs. I told them...everything I knew. I gave them so much...and in the end it didn't seem like anything at all. You don't know anything, Dwight. But that's what I like about you. I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone now I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San Francisco... When You're a fool, Dwight. That reminds me of something, Dwight. Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it Sounds lovely. Where is it What're you doing Dwight Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it. He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel. He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to his friends... ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job. He and Lee, they never even met. After Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured framing Bobby'd give me a way out... Then last year...the fourth manthe driverhe heard Bobby was getting paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt that Lee framed him. He wanted money we didn't have. Ten thousand dollars. Promise me this Forgive him for DeWitt. Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't matter anymore. Not to us. Baxter Fitch. He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him everything else. But don't forgive him for that. Ever. Dwight Dwight I didn't touch your things. You can have the furniture. Did you think I'd let my husband disappear for three weeks and do nothing about it I've had detectives following you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like that fucking dead girl, so you can have hernot me. Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile. Dwight You are so, so good at some things. He was going to leave no matter what. I didn't know if I was ever going to see him again, and I wanted him to be comfortable if such a thing was possible. Dwight, he knew I was in love with you, and he wanted us to be together. Goddammit, Dwight! That girlthat girl! I don't give a damn about that girl. She ruined our lives! He loved us. Don't take that away from him. And I love you. And if you hadn't seen so much of yourself in her you'd realize how much you loved me. beat So if you're aware of something more important than that...I'd like to hear what it is.",751,"[Lee, drag, taking, somme, art, classes, sketch, boxers, moral, reasons, hope, LAPD, gets, ridiculed, perpetrating, farce, financial, reasons, hope, Lee, wins, aesthetic, reasons, hope, look, good, shirts, Luck, Dwight, looks, good, shirt, good, Ended, degree, History, Masters, Lee, fight, money, paid, asked, catching, animals, gave, sense, order, girlfriend, Dwight, getting, married, wondering, Dwight, Good, luck, tomorrow, night, Lee, sleep, Dwight, Hello, Dwight, Glad, Lucky, man, beat, Lee, Dinner, fairy, tales, Oh, baby, Oh, babe, Bobby, DeWitt, gets, week, Dwight, edge, swore, trial, going, kill, Lee, Lee, scared, know, Bobby, Hi, Dwight, Lee, stomps, tread, lightly, Let, guess, Lee, night, probably, Benzedrine, againworking, poor, girl, murder, worried, worried, worried, left, cautious, man, hardcase, Good, night, Hi, Dwight, Lee, Dwight, kind, theorizing, nonsense, theory, eat, calm, guess, maybe, killers, torture, cuts, crude, bisection, cut, abdomen, neat, clean, sick, insane, happen, Dwight, gutless, famous, Dwight, seen, beat, blame, want, coming, sleep, couch, know, Dwight, Fighting, cops, guns, peoplethat, scary, stuff, Luck, Luck, spent, morning, Internal, Affairs, told, knew, gave, end, like, know, Dwight, like, offered, job, Teaching, sixth, grade, Fairfax, Primary, Lee, gone, sick, days, Maybe, trip, Santa, Barbara, drive, San, Francisco, fool, Dwight, reminds, Dwight, Floorboard, loose, near, closet, Think, fix, Sounds, lovely, Dwight, Oh, wondered, kept, given, money, Ben, Siegel, knew, Bobby, razor, pimped, friends, Bobby, know, bank, job, Lee, met, Lee, driver, got, away, Lee, figured, framing, Bobby'd, way, year, fourth, manthe, driverhe, heard, Bobby, getting, paroled, threatened, tell, DeWitt, Lee, framed, wanted, money, thousand, dollars, Promise, Forgive, DeWitt, Forgive, bank, matter, anymore, Baxter, Fitch, Dwight, Forgive, forgive, Dwight, Dwight, touch, things, furniture, think, let, husband, disappear, weeks, detectives, following, Dwight, Detectives, looks, like, fucking, dead, girl, hernot, Whoremonger, Coward, Necrophile, Dwight, good, things, going, leave, matter, know, going, wanted, comfortable, thing, possible, Dwight, knew, love, wanted, Goddammit, Dwight, girlthat, girl, damn, girl, ruined, lives, loved, away, love, seen, realize, loved, beat, aware, important, I'd, like, hear]",0.0821917808219178,0.17123287671232876,0.0684931506849315,0.0684931506849315,0.1780821917808219,0.14383561643835616,0.2945205479452055,0.0958904109589041,0.1643835616438356,0.1506849315068493,"[-1.69439436e-01  1.58175359e-01 -1.09281653e-01 -1.43509872e-01

9,MADELEINE,Black Dahlia,2006,False,"I am now. Daddy spying on me again Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin' in such unsuitable places Well that's a new one This is all a fluke. I met them at LaVerne's last fall. Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple. She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister. No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat. Ye might say I take it where I can find it, laddie. Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The Emmett Sprague. He built half of Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he didn't build he bought. Imagine the headlines. Tycoon's Daughter Questioned in Black Dahlia CasePlayed Footsie with Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub. Get the picture Linda talked about her boring boy back in Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty talked about the latest issue of Screen World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine yards. On a conversational level they were right down there with you, only they were better looking. You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to hear my alibi so I can end this farce and go home My family and I were at our house in Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along with our livein servants. If you want verification, call Daddy. But be discreet about where we met. Don't suppose I can convince you to keep my name out of the papers Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying... Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address is 482 So. Muirfield. Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a gentleman. One more thingWhat's your name I'll try to remember. Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has heard about you. He insisted you stay for dinner. I told him we met at that art exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if you have to pump everybody for my alibi, be subtle. All right That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in the paper when Daddy's accountant told him he'd made his first million. Daddy wanted to consecrate the moment so he shot him. Here we go Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family. My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha McConville Sprague. Daddy can we eat Bucky and I want to catch a ninethirty show. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family don'tthey're not so bad Until we announce the wedding She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead. You know how Daddy really made his money He bought rotten lumber and abandoned movie facades from Mack Sennett and built houses out of them. He's got firetraps all over LA registered to phony corporations...His good friend George Disfigured in a car crash while running Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him scraps nowodd jobs tending some rental property I want to. I like you Bucky. Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty Short. Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just don't want to lie to you. Last summer I was barhopping a lot. Straight bars. I heard about a girl who looked like me. I got curious and left notes at a couple places Your lookalike wants to meet you, things like that. I left my number. She called. That's how I met her at LaVerne's with Linda. Yes. That's all of it. Serve my family right. No. I don't. I've worked pretty hard to be loose and free. But the way people described Betty. It sounded like she was a natural. Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from nothing...But then she carried nothing with her, either. I don't know...when you're rich sometimes you romanticize the poor... Hello. When Not at the house. Daddy's having a business soiree. The Red Arrow. Room 11. Fortyfive minutes. Smile at me. Look soft and sweet. Did she mention me Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that one time we met last summer. I just did it to see what it would be like to do it with someone who looked like me and Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay Stay sugar stay You'll be back. beat I look like her. What You miss 'em, laddie Mother's insults Martha's pornography... I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is. Georgie was always...sneaking around Daddy's properties. He saw them make it...He...got crazy about Betty. It was Sunday I remember...Betty called...short of cash as usual. I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty money to date a nice man he knew. Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy, wanting to get with Betty ever since the movie. Threatening to tell people he was my father. But we thought Georgie just wanted her for sex. We said he was a war hero. Because we didn't want her to feel like a whore. You know the rest. I went looking for Linda Martin, and I found her at a motel in the Valley. I gave her money and told her to say the stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican crew. Bucky Bucky Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that was all. But she's a demon, you know. She even called the cops with a tip on La Verne'sjust hoping I'd get smeared in the papers. I scratched her good for that. Figures. We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what Some little slut Don't come over.

10,RAMONA,Black Dahlia,2006,True,"Madeleine says nice things about you. Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona Boulevard was named after me When Emmett married me for my father's money he promised my family that he would use his influence with the City Zoning Board to have a street named after me. But all he could manage was a deadend block in a red light district in Lincoln Heights. Are you familiar with the neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert Then you know that the Mexican prostitutes expose themselves out of windows to attract customers. I hear many of them know Mr. Sprague by name I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's male whores. A common policeman. My God, Emmett. How little you think of me. I'm in here, officer. We see you out there, you know. Every night. We see you. You don't fool us. You didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt Madeleine. And as much as I wish you would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a voyeur. That's all the lesser classes have. Pressing their nose up against the glass. Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked just like Georgie. When he got out of the hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely spoke. It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become obsessed with her...That filthy film. Emmett never stopped hating me. For being richer than he was. I followed them to the bungalow. There was a baseball bat under...under a tree...She tried to run from me...but she was drunk. The first swing knocked her out. I made Georgie tie her to the mattress....The second swing woke her up. She looked so much like my Maddy. It was...the cruelest of jokes. Martha mustn't know. She's all that's left of this family that isn't dying. You consider her when you decide whether we're worth it. Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought Martha was going to bring the whole family down around her by chance. Her little stunt about tipping the police to LaVerne's Oh is that so You poor boy. Your life is worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is on you.",375,"[Madeleine, says, nice, things, know, Mr., Bleichert, Ramona, Boulevard, named, Emmett, married, father, money, promised, family, use, influence, City, Zoning, Board, street, named, manage, deadend, block, red, light, district, Lincoln, Heights, familiar, neighborhood, Mr., Bleichert, know, Mexican, prostitutes, expose, windows, attract, customers, hear, know, Mr., Sprague, sing, supper, Mayor, Bowron, comes, dinner, Madeleine, male, whores, common, policeman, God, Emmett, little, think, officer, know, night, fool, hurt, Georgie, hurt, Madeleine, wish, hurt, Emmett, voyeur, lesser, classes, Pressing, nose, glass, Emmett, slashed, face, sure, know, Madeleine, looked, like, Georgie, got, hospital, gave, Hugo, book, present, Gwynplain, afraid, Emmett, rage, rarely, spoke, cruelest, jokes, obsessed, filthy, film, Emmett, stopped, hating, richer, followed, bungalow, baseball, bat, tree, tried, run, drunk, swing, knocked, Georgie, tie, mattress, second, swing, woke, looked, like, Maddy, cruelest, jokes, Martha, know, left, family, dying, consider, decide, worth, Honestly, thought, Martha, going, bring, family, chance, little, stunt, tipping, police, LaVerne, Oh, poor, boy, life, worse, Maybe, cruel, joke]",0.13043478260869565,0.13043478260869565,0.11594202898550725,0.17391304347826086,0.07246376811594203,0.2318840579710145,0.2028985507246377,0.11594202898550725,0.057971014492753624,0.17391304347826086,"[-5.09911504e-02  1.02241158e-01 -1.10405731e-01 -6.67852011e-02

Yeah, at the motel. I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm writing our story. Just let me finish this line. 112. Okay, here it is. The Story of Bonnie and Clyde You've heard the story of Jesse James Of how he lived and died If you're still in need Of something to read Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde. Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow Gang I'm sure you all have read How they rob and steal And those who squeal Are usually found dying or dead. They call them coldhearted killers They say they are heartless and mean But I say this with pride, That I once knew Clyde When he was honest and upright and clean. But the laws fooled around, Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, I'll never be free So I'll meet a few of them in hell. The road was so dimly lighted There were no highway signs to guide But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died. 113. If they try to act like citizens And rent them a nice little flat About the third night They're invited to fight By a subgun's rattattat. Some day they'll go down together They'll bury them side by side To few it'll be grief To the law a relief But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde. 114. mistake, happy The Story. steadily, her slight smile growing Fine. Just. 117. great warmth Hey.  You done just perfect. How could I do that, Clyde  You know it's impossible.  We'd have to go to a Justice of the Peace and the Justice of the Peace is a lawman.  We couldn't even take out a license. her voice getting more and more emotional Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I haven't thought about it at least ten times a day, I haven't thought about it every minute of my life since I met you. cracks into tears buried in CLYDE's chest, she whispers Clyde, why do you want to marry me 121. charged with anticipation and dream Clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us He stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy. You plannin' to drive with your shoes off You gonna wear 'em Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon Just look here, you can see every little fingernail on her hands.

I mean there's nothin' wrong with me, I don't like boys. Boy, what Wait! If all you want's stud service, then get on back to West Dallas and stay there the rest of your life! But you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me.  You could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate. But it does make a damn to me! 11. Why  Because you're different! You're like me and you want different things. You and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time.  We can be somethin' we could never be alone. I'll show you...when we walk into the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name.

So you got your job in the cafe... home now, hitting them right in there And every morning you wake up and you hate it.  You just hate it. And you get down there and you put on your white uniform 13. And the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it...And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go...but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not...and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will I ever get away from this...And now you know. Change that.  I don't like it. God, you're a knockout. Sure it is. Don't mean we have to go home in it. Hey, lady. Slept out by the car. No...If they're after us, I want the first shot.

I killed a man.  We're in this now. Hey, y'all, listen to this here Law enforcement officers throughout the Southwest are frankly amazed at the way in which willofthewisp bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow haired companion, Bonnie Parker, continue to elude their wouldbe captors.  Since engaging the police in a gun battle on the streets of Joplin Missouri and slaying three of their number... ...the Barrow gang has been reported as far West as White City, New Mexico, and as far north as Chicago. They have been credited with robbing the Mesquite Bank in the aforementioned White City, the J.J. Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas, the Sanger City National Bank in Denton, Texas on three different occasions.  In addition to these robberies, the fast travelling Barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and one AP store in Missouri, though Chief Percy Hammond, who first identified Clyde Barrow's brother, Buck, as a member of the gang, expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the Barrow Gang alone. Hey now, here's something!  Listen here Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer Howard Anderson's heart turned faster than his motorcycle when he forced to the side of the road a roaring black V8 sedan in which were three men and a blondheaded woman yesterday afternoon. When he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain he'd caught Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and maybe Buck Barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang. It took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blondehaired stenographer from the Highway Patrol.  Haw!  Haw! with laughter 57. Anderson was held up as an example for every other Texas peace officer today. That was a mighty brave thing, explained Highway Patrol Chief L.C. Winston. Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin' like that! Say there, peacemaker.  I believe you got your spurs all tangled up. You're in Missouri, you know that Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so personal. Like how, Clyde C.W. Shoot him. C.W. ...hang him... possibilities immediately ...yeah, yeah...

Move into him, right close, right friendly. ...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it. I got the picture.  I got the picture... Clyde, yelling I got the PICTURE! 62. Don't do nothin' silly now. Get a good look at us!  We're the Barrow boys. Happy birthday. Kick it in the pants, C.W. 64.

I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought them for Walter but he didn't like the fabric, so WALTER O.S. Ow! Are you all right WALTER I fell.   Stupid tub. Did you hurt yourself     Let me see ...circumcised.... The last time I measured Walter the last time I measured my son he was four inches taller than you are right now. Who are you What are you doing here Who are you He's not my son. I don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake. He's four inches shorter than Walter. Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller. He's circumcised. Walter wasn't. Made him smaller Captain, please why won't you listen to me Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof. I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter. But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt.... And I don't Captain, look, I don't want to cause trouble for you or the department. Honestly I don't. I know you've done everything you can...but there's been a terrible mistake, and I need your help if we're going to correct it...before it's too late. Please. Oh...yes, of course. Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me. Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me. My motherly concern isn't for him because he's not my son. He's four inches shorter than What about the circumcision Look, doctor Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son I'm his mother. What're you Dr. Tarr Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you have the time Thank you. This is absolutely outrageous! Captain, I...no, listen to me, this socalled doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not No, I am not reassured. I thought we had an understanding, I That I was embarrassed isn't the issue, the point is you're wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right Fine. WALTER I'm finished. Can I go to my room now Yes.   Go on up. WALTER G'night, Mommy. Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son! WHO ARE YOU WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK! I want my son back...god, please... make it stop...just make it stop. I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him. Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth. Hello Yes   Who is this Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son...you were very supportive, and I appreciate No, I Acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist, examined Walter Collins to determine the cause of his loss of weight, paleness, confusion and rundown condition noticed since the return of the boy to his mother last Saturday. I examined the boy quite thoroughly, Dr. Tarr said Captain Jones promised he'd let me see the report before it went anywhere else. Why are they doing this Thank you. I've been trying to get someone to say those words since...god, I was starting to think I was losing my mind. Thank you. At least someone believes me. Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing...but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing...but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up.... What do I have to do Well And... Does a gap like that get smaller with age Because that's what they'll say. Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially Well What do you think Is that the Walter Collins that you remember Good morning. My name is Christine Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins, disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. They were wrong. The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistake...a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not my son. That is the reason for the supposed transformation. I have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should have them for you tomorrow. I have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me. Thank you. Why are we using the back door Is it It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone. No, of course not. I had to get your attention, I had to make you understand...he's not my son. That's not true! I don't know! All I know is that he's lying! Just a minute I'm not going to sit here and take this Yes. Wait...what are you doing No...wait, you can't Wait...please, this is a mistake. Please...you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy Oh, god...oh god, please, no.... No, please, you have to listen to me...wait...please! Why That's not necessary The morning But...wait, I've got to talk to someone in authority Then if I could just use the phone. Wait...please! There's been a terrible mistake! I'm sorry, I Can I see the doctor   Or someone in charge But I Christine.     Christine Collins. I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane. You seem to have given this a great deal of thought. What about you But how can they Fine.   Thank you. Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable. Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind. No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure. But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. However inappropriate that might be. I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing. Yes. People don't change, doctor. That's not what I No.    Of course not. That's right. What for What kind of medication I don't want to relax...I'm fine, and I won't take something unless I know what it is! Just listen Doctor...Doctor Steele I don't know what's going on, but I'm not taking anything until I don't have anything wrong with me that I should have to take medication. That's right. Yes. I won't sign it. I won't sign it! I was not wrong! That boy is not my son! And I am not going to stop telling the truth about this! And you're not going to stop me, and the police aren't going to stop me I will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if I have to, but one way or another No! No, I won't let you!     Someone, please, help me! Carol!   No, leave her alone!    What're you Carol....! You shouldn't have done that. I won't...I won't. That's hardly appropriate language for a lady, now is it And when's that Fuck you....and the horse...you rode in on. No. ...what Next door. I am out. I don't know...but I couldn't go without saying goodbye I will...but I want you to know once I have my boy back, I'm coming back here...for you, and the others. This is wrong, and we can stop it Watch me. No...god...no.... A little better, thanks. The sleep helped. Anything new outside I want to go home. I've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since I got out of that...place. All those women, and what they did about Walter.... They're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they Nothing's going to change...unless we make it change. I used to tell Walter, Never start a fight...but always finish it. I didn't start this fight...but by god I'm going to finish it. Always finish it. Always. Hello. Yes...of course. Mr. Hahn, was it I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's. Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me. I'm sorry.     Please, sit. I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary. Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board. I see.... Of course. One thing, though. A personal favor. When we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown. It's all right...everything's going to be all right now.... Reverend, what I don't understand. I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I get you anything Where is all this traffic's coming from... Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead He didn't mean...he couldn't mean Oh...my.... But...shouldn't we I'm up here, Reverend. When Walter was...when he was here, I'd walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if I couldn't see him, or hear him, I could...feel him in here. That's why I don't think Walter is dead. I can still feel him, in this room. I know what the police said. But the remains...what they found on that ranch is so...most of it can't even be properly identified. What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to keep looking. Maybe he's waiting for me, somewhere. Ten minute break We'll see.     Thanks, Ben. Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, we spoke yesterday about my son...fine, thank you. I was wondering if you'd had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case anyone resembling Walter had I see. No, thank you, I appreciate the information. Would it be all right if I called you again, in a month or so Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, hello, I was just From who Why No, I'm...sure I'll be fine. No, I don't smoke. That's where they do what Mr. Northcott...you asked me to come to see you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well, I'm here. Now what What Why not Mr. Northcott...look at me. Look at me. Did you...kill...my son Mr. Northcott No, wait, please Did you kill him Did you kill my son Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott! I can't...I've got a million forms to fill out Sandy, you guys blew out the phone lines between here and Baltimore, someone has to clean up the mess, and that's me. Besides, I've got a radio right here, I can follow the whole thing. Positive.    Go on, have fun. I said I can't go Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish I could...but I really need to stay and finish this. Ben... I put down two dollars on It Happened One Night for best picture. Seems I'm the only one here who thinks it has a chance against Cleopatra. If I win, how about we have dinner tomorrow night to celebrate 'Night. I'll be here. Overrated.... Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert.   I rest my case. I knew it...I knew it!   I told you so! Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, I Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay No, of course I remember you, how are you Is everything When Where did they No, of course...I'll be right there. Are they sure it's But how I am. Why not Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I didn't have before tonight. Hope.

But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it. Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard. Look.  We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted shit.  And they're sniffing around like dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case... You know I remember that. Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck... Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing... Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to something and you don't let it go. I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else.  I can't tell any more. But I can tell you one thing.

They're all over everybody. That's I.A.'s pit bull. Detective... Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality. What about these contusions Any signs of rape Wait. He washed her hair. Combed it. Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped them. Toes, too. You found nothing on the body No fibers, skin flakes, hairs... He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks. Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There should be a reservation for us. I'm always all business. Is it really 930 Come on in. What do you want to talk about We'll talk when we get back to Seattle. You know my plan of action. That's right. He's asking everybody questions. He's just rattling your cage. We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that. Weston Dobbs killed an eight yearold boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that One word to I.A. and he walks. No way. Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that sonof bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions. I care. You got to be kidding me. Think I'll pass. What kind of calls you get around here Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.

Could Randy Stetz afford these Well her mother didn't buy them for her. Kay Connell had an admirer. I want to talk to the boyfriend. You don't seem all that sad. Did you love her Kay Connell.  Did you love her She was nice.  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back You heard me that time. But she was seeing someone else on the side. Friday night, at the party  what'd you fight about What kind of stuff The other guy After that she left the party to go to him. Ran like hell to go to him... Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fucktheworldMetallicatshirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me.  You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else.  You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is You don't know. Just a little. I want you to check this out, Ellie. Do it again. The small things  remember  The second you're about to dismiss something  look at it again. Who's that Good.  He's up next. Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia. Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and chips... Can't wait to see what's for dessert. Looks like the natives are restless. Don't do this, Hap... Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing... You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not... I'll just have another Scotch in my room. If you don't mind. Where is it We're sure it's hers Biology and Algebra. Find out who she studied with. Makeup. Find out where she bought it. Lab. Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset. Who here reads this kind of crap Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes you. Lab. That's it. No. We put it back where we found it. You said it was a fishing cabin. This murder was in the papers, right Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. We can get it in by the morning editions. Fill this with random books.  Make it look heavy. It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail. I told her to come. That's him. Fan out. Stay here, Ellie. Go!  Go!  Go! Police! Goddammit! You!  Head back up to base... You!  Go right and follow along the water... Hap!  You go left... Go! Where is he Where'd the shot come from Freeze! Hap! Hap! And then I lost him.  In the fog. Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the sound down to the water.  That's where... That's where I found Hap. Why didn't I know about that goddamn tunnel, Charlie I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son ofabitch.  Playing with me.  And I missed the shot.  He was right there and I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun jammed... I had him! I'm going to check on the roadblocks... You were nice to him.  He liked you. Dormer. That's not exactly how I'd put it. What do you mean, Funny You know why everyone hates you, Warfield  It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself.  Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of.  You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner! Next time.  Go ahead and lie. Goddammit! Goddamned...thing! Hap! It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're doing your job. I was here. I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now. You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twentyfive minutes.  Don't waste any time. I'm not. How's the book Thanks. He would have liked that. That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. Anything.  It's important. No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your fault. How's the leg Right.  Got lost in the rocks. ...Anything catches your eye, you put it in a bag.  Anything looks strange, you put it in a bag... ...Anything he may have dropped, moved, kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag. Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper clips, coins, buttons  nine times out of ten a suspect leaves something behind... The woods.  One group heading south, the other heading north. Anything Alright.  Go back and set up some follow ups for this afternoon. He had to have exited here.  Over those boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble. Would have taken the hardest way out. Thanks. Habit. Fred Duggar I'm not expecting anyone. What did he look like I need to borrow something. CUT BACK TO I could say the same thing about you. Who's playing She your only sibling No. Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I was eleven. It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico. Not really. I remember I was more embarrassed that he had died.  Embarrassed that it made me different.  So I didn't tell the other kids at school what had happened.  They'd ask me where he was, where he'd gone.  And I'd make up stories.  He was visiting an aunt up north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a Swiss boarding school.  Stuff like that. Nice kid, huh  Just kept making up more and more lies... I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records. Officer!... I'll pick it up.  You head back to the station. Duggar  I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll be back in about twenty minutes... I thought it was better if I came.  Under the circumstances. Thanks, Doc. So where's the other bullets What's with all the moose antlers around here When's Rich coming First I need a copy of the key. Dormer. Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every... What Who is this I said, who is this Now you listen to me... Right. Then change it. I don't remember. Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet.  Put down whatever you want in your report, alright These should have gone out two hours ago. You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second. Why don't I give her a ride Good to see you, too, Randy. You're not missing much. You were good friends with Kay Connell, weren't you Best friend That's a long time. Must be tough for you.  What happened. What about Kay's other friends You want me to take you somewhere How about this.  You like this Thought you wanted something fun... You and Kay were like sisters Told each other everything. That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral You like games, little girl  Well how about this one  you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz Who gave her those dresses I need a name. You don't know. But you were such good friends... What was Who Who What was it Lucy.  Desi. Goddammit! What Good. No. That's right. So I don't think it'll lead anywhere. Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call. I'm fine. Walter Byrd. You think this is a nice meeting we're having here  Friendly  Two people getting acquainted You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down.  Beating a seventeen year old girl to death.  Washing her afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel like a real man Huh I outta end this right now.  Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in... That was an accident!  You hear me  I didn't know it was him! I didn't know it was him! What's your game, Byrd The phone call.  The knapsack. Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are partners on nothing. You're going to get a phone call. I said you're going to get a phone call. Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books. You're going to be brought in for questioning. Yes down at the station. What do you mean, wild card What do you mean wild card I have a cold. Back to the Lodge. I trust you. Duggar called him Not really. No.  But it sounds like something I would've said. See you tomorrow, Ellie. Listen to me, you sonofabitch... Goddammit, Byrd! I didn't know! Fuck! CUT BACK TO What is it I'm fine. No. The light.  It keeps coming in... There was this guy named Weston Dobbs. Twentyfour.  Worked as a parttime stock boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight yearold boy get picked up by his carpool across the street.  And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again.  He did this for about six months.  Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for three days. Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do things... When he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building.  But he didn't do a good enough job.  The little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock.  The landlord found him five days later. Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment. We took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment. Arrested him the next day. There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence. But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything. We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal. Do you think it was wrong  What we did What was the nature of your relationship She was an attractive girl.  Did you have sex with her But she was an attractive girl. Did you have sex with her But you wanted to. You gave her gifts. Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace. Doesn't sound like a mentor to me. What about him That's an understatement. I like it fine. They haven't been easy. It's legitimate. The case is closed, Ellie. I got the next round. What the hell are you doing calling me at the station Randy Stetz is in jail. Congratulations. The tape. There's nothing more to talk about. We do nothing well together. Nothing!  You understand me What the hell do you know I told you that was an accident! Don't you pull that shit with me. Couldn't get it up, Walter Like this This an accident, Walter It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.  Ten minutes. Get the fuck out of town, Byrd.  Leave and never come back. Sixthirty. I have to get back. Had a lot of help from Nightmute's finest. No. I'm here to end this. No backup. Procedure went out the window a long time ago. That's where you're wrong, Walter. There is no secret.  Because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with... Walter Walter! Drop the gun, Walter. Another J. Brody mystery. God, you're a pain in the ass. You, too. Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house. Byrd's dead. Yes. No.  But I covered it up.  I lied. Because I just couldn't be wrong. Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't ever lose your way.  It blurs the line. Just let me sleep, Ellie... Let me sleep.

37,ELLIE,Insomnia,2002,False,"Hey, Mr. Angstrom! Police business. I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom. Just made detective three weeks ago. Detective Dormer! It's a huge honor to meet you!  Ellie Burr.  I'm here to take you to the station! Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute! I just want to say how incredible it is to have you working with us, Detective Dormer.  I've followed all your cases. Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings... ...And especially the Leland Street Murders.  That was my case study at the Academy. Sure thing, Spence. That's where Ronald Langley cut you in the basement of his father's house on 325 Leland, isn't it Actually... I just made detective three weeks ago. Yes, sir. Oh.  Right.  Okay. Don't worry about him... He's just mad 'cause you're taking over. Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's. Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case you were hungry. Local delicacy. Oh.  You know.  Smalltime stuff. Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly drinkingrelated problems.  Domestic abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that. In the summer months it's pretty quiet. That's when there's work out on the boats.  The rest of the year, though... Hey, there, Joe! That's Joe Willy.  Took his family hostage in November.  That was the most exciting thing that happened last year. I wasn't there, though. Chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor. But they're so boring.  All small stuff. Let me just... Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. He fixes boat engines. He's a little surly, isn't he We already did. But there wasn't any... You want me to write that down The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night. Over here. On the beach. Yeah.  All over. Brought some coffee... Anything yet WILL                    FRED Nothing.                Nothing. But... You wanted to see me But what about the Connell case  I'm on the Connell case. Detective Dormer I'm sorry to bother you, but I was asked to write the report on... ...you know what I was asked to write the report on... ...Could you, just to be accurate, for the report, could you just point out where you were when you saw Detective Eckhart yesterday I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know you did everything you could... He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great detective. ...and it was at this point that Detective Dormer headed towards the noise... Remember, Kepp, shoot everything... ...wherein he discovered the wounded Detective Farrell Brooks, having been shot in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh... Francis! You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain. Accuracy.  That's what. Now get down. ...shortly after hearing the second shot, Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body, lying approximately fifteen feet away. Looks back up.  Fog.  Clicks off the recorder.  Calls out. You there, Rich Detective Dormer!  What are you doing here It's twothirty in the morning. Shouldn't you be asleep Oh.  We always have playoffs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time. The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good lineup this year. That's my sister. That's okay, Lib! Usually she's better. Twelve years younger. What about you  You have any siblings Oh, I shouldn't have... That must have been awful for you. You okay CUT BACK TO Okay. Try to get some sleep! Detective Dormer! You look like you're in a hurry.  I just wanted to ask you about these pictures. I know they're not great quality, but this is where you said you were when you first saw Detective Eckhart, right But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog. How much closer would you say you were Five feet  Seven feet Which way are you walking I needed to get your signature on something. The report on Detective Eckhart.  Chief made me finish it this morning.  Said it was taking too long. Aren't you going to read it Now I can help you with the Connell case. That writer's coming in tomorrow.  Walter Byrd. About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate. You haven't been sleeping much, have you, Detective Dormer Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. You said that once, remember Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins won. The baseball game.  Our team... ...We won. When did you first meet her Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell Hi, guys. Yeah. I know.  I heard. I found this out on the beach. Shell casing.  9mm. None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon. And the murder weapon was a 357. It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer Worth pursuing Me, Pop! Where's all my academy stuff Didn't want to miss anything. Good. Sure. I thought what you did on this case was amazing. We're really going to miss you around here. Very funny, Farrell... Hi, Rachel. Detective Dormer Shit! Detective Dormer! You're shot. I'm going to make a tourniquet. I know. You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you Did you mean to Why This one looks worse. No! I will not let you sleep.  If you've lost your way then you have to make it right. That's the only way.  That's what you'd tell me.  I've been a detective for four weeks and I say you're coming with me. C'mon... Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

38,CHIEF NYBACK,Insomnia,2002,False,"Will Dormer! I'll be damned! Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since... What's that, then Seven years  Where does it all go  That was some amazing time, though, wasn't it You haven't changed a bit, Will. I knew that was coming.  I deserve it. Pay attention to this man, Ellie.  He'll teach you how to be a great cop. That's all, for now. Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it. I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement. Looks like it's a good time for you to get up here, too.  With all the bad business going on down at Special Branch. Just five bad apples so far What's the D.A. got them on How about you  How you faring Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield. Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here. I'm just glad Buck could spare you a couple of weeks.  Take you out of the frenzy.  I gotta tell you, though, I sure don't miss big city police work.  Not that I was ever a great detective.  But up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No Public Relations.  No blurred lines. Just good guys and bad guys.  Simple. Except for this. Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not a trace.  Town's never dealt with anything like this before. I've briefed everybody about your coming. They know to follow your lead. This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch.  They'll be helping with the Connell case. Anything they need to see, you show them anywhere they want to go, you take them. This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been leading the investigation up to now. And then you lost him. About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot I think you need a glass of this. There's a bunch of those tunnels out there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty years old.  I don't even know half of them myself, and I grew up here. Will, you can't blame yourself. It's only gonna make you crazy. Right, Ellie. I want you to take care of the investigation into Detective Eckhart's shooting. We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that. Just write up a quick report. You're no good right now, Will.  Go back to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest. ...We're going to bring down a couple of guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to step up the investigation here... ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirtyseven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case.  I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years.  He was a fine detective and an even better man. Fred, you'll be working with Detective Dormer directly from now on. Will  Anything you'd like to add Okay.  Then let's get to it. I was hoping not to send you back with so much paperwork, Will. When are you taking off Can't talk you into staying for a couple of days  Do some fishing  Show you what normally goes on around here. Too bad... ...Brought some real class to the place. But, Seattle needs its hero back. Couldn't have done it without you, Will. Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours. Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.",608,"[Dormer, damned, Christ, seen, boys, Seven, years, amazing, time, changed, bit, knew, coming, deserve, Pay, attention, man, Ellie, teach, great, cop, Got, love, affair, police, work, Drives, crazy, told, seven, years, ago, stepping, stone, retirement, Looks, like, good, time, bad, business, going, Special, Branch, bad, apples, far, D.A., got, faring, Got, bunch, messages, guy, named, Warfield, Wants, posted, movements, glad, Buck, spare, couple, weeks, frenzy, got, ta, tell, sure, miss, big, city, police, work, great, detective, Bureaucracy, Public, Relations, blurred, lines, good, guys, bad, guys, Simple, thing, body, trace, Town, dealt, like, briefed, everybody, coming, know, follow, lead, Detective, Dormer, partner, Detective, Eckhart, loan, Buck, Lundgard, Seattle, Robbery, Homicide, Special, Branch, helping, Connell, case, need, want, Detective, Fred, Duggar, leading, investigation, lost, long, til, heard, suspect, second, shot, think, need, glass, bunch, tunnels, bunkers, years, old, know, half, grew, blame, gon, na, crazy, Right, Ellie, want, care, investigation, Detective, Eckhart, shooting, need, paperwork, Ellie, know, write, quick, report, good, right, Lodge, Try, rest, going, bring, couple, guys, Ridgemount, want, step, investigation, Nightmute, lost, officer, thirtyseven, years, Detective, Eckhart, good, case, honor, working, Seattle, number, years, fine, detective, better, man, Fred, working, Detective, Dormer, directly, like, add, Okay, let, hoping, send, paperwork, taking, talk, staying, couple, days, fishing, normally, goes, bad, Brought, real, class, place, Seattle, needs, hero, Detective, Dormer, leaving, hours, Maybe, drive, Spencer]",0.10833333333333334,0.15,0.058333333333333334,0.16666666666666666,0.1,0.2,0.23333333333333334,0.11666666666666667,0.075,0.14166666666666666,"[-5.34500742e-02  1.28450815e-01 -1.42843163e-01 -3.60343007e-02

40,WALTER,Insomnia,2002,True,"When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions.  Stood the whole time. His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was like a soldier, but better. Made a huge impression on me.  His goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for the police.  I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but... Congenital problem. Oh.  We're here. You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day And on a clear day you can see all the way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful aviary over there.  We can go sometime. It's actually cool for this time of year. Normally the temperature runs about... I stood right behind you...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him... ...Seattle's great hero.  Shooting his own partner.  I saw it all... Then why lie about it I mean, I'm all for bending the truth. That's what I do in my novels.  It's my trade you might say.  But why cover it up You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.  I'm sure you have some reason. Something noble.  I have faith in that. They should be bundled up better. No game. I figured we're partners on this one.  I mean, after what I saw... I research my novels.  I know the procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry.  You'd have called for back up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment.  You're a wellrespected detective.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now... ...except that we could help each other. So.  We're at an impasse. I'm sorry Oh Thought you might find that. Down at the station Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning. Good.  I can write this. Ferry's leaving. Something to divert... My gun.  You still have my gun, right Then that's the wild card.  Every detective story has a wild card. Next ferry's in fortyfive minutes. You'll know.  At the questioning. You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I know you would... Yes I was. She was, not quite a fan.  More an avid reader of my detective novels. A year ago.  At one of my signings. That's right. She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books. Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week... What do you mean, Detective Dormer She was only seventeen. I suppose. No. I was a mentor to her. Yes. Yes. I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have. Her family lives on Mr. Connell's disability.  It isn't much. She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to. That boyfriend.  Randy. That's right. He.  Well, he... I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence.  As a friend. Well.  He hit her. She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret. He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him. Could I have some more coffee, Detective Burr Hi, Will... I figured we should touch base.  Compare notes.  I think it went well.  What did you think Told you I could write an ending. I thought maybe we could talk some more. But we work so well together... You run on two settings, Will.  I've noticed that... You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too. You're not sleeping, are you Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me. Does Detective Eckhart come to you Does he ask you why you shot him Then so was mine... I didn't want to kill her, Will. When she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with Randy. Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at our special place.  The cabin at the beach... ...When she came she was barefoot.  And there was liquor on her breath.  I only wanted to comfort her.  To touch her. She could have at least let me do that. Her skin...it was like everything I'd ever written about. It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. From calm to rage in the blink of an eye. Remember Yes.  Like that. If you want it to be... I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake. I'm going to write my next novel there. It's about a famous detective who goes bad. Just kidding. The never coming back part, though.  I'm not sure.  To tell you the truth this has been kind of fun.  Going to the station, meeting all those nice people.  Talking with you. I might miss it. I especially like that new detective. Detective Burr. I liked her very much.  Has a real vitality. Here to visit me Where's your backup You're not following procedure. We're on the same side, Will.  You know that.  After what we've been through together.  We're partners.  Bound by a secret. Will... You give the police a bad name, Will. Wild card. That jammed the last time, remember",1053,"[seven, mother, grandmother, took, Vancouver, walking, street, day, men, ran, past, snatched, grandmother, purse, right, arm, Right, arm, night, police, officer, came, hotel, room, ask, questions, Stood, time, uniform, looked, brand, new, shoes, badge, polished, billy, club, belt, buckle, perfect, like, soldier, better, huge, impression, goodness, Gave, instant, respect, police, tried, cop, left, high, school, Congenital, problem, Oh, know, glacier, moves, quarter, inch, day, clear, day, way, Newtok, beautiful, aviary, actually, cool, time, year, Normally, temperature, runs, stood, right, saw, look, right, eyes, shoot, Seattle, great, hero, Shooting, partner, saw, lie, mean, bending, truth, novels, trade, cover, tell, want, sure, reason, noble, faith, bundled, better, game, figured, partners, mean, saw, research, novels, know, procedures, cuffed, ferry, called, read, rights, gotten, search, warrant, apartment, wellrespected, detective, reason, talking, right, help, impasse, sorry, Oh, Thought, find, station, Okay, Okay, Brought, questioning, Good, write, Ferry, leaving, divert, gun, gun, right, wild, card, detective, story, wild, card, ferry, fortyfive, minutes, know, questioning, thing, know, Yes, fan, avid, reader, detective, novels, year, ago, signings, right, flattered, writing, Asked, visit, talk, books, Yes, comfortable, Started, visiting, week, mean, Detective, Dormer, seventeen, suppose, mentor, Yes, Yes, gave, things, family, lives, Mr., Connell, disability, happy, talk, boyfriend, Randy, right, want, talk, school, Kay, told, things, strictest, confidence, friend, hit, come, middle, night, Bruises, upper, arms, pled, let, police, hear, Wanted, secret, terrible, rage, Kay, said, carried, handgun, coffee, Detective, Burr, Hi, figured, touch, base, Compare, notes, think, went, think, Told, write, ending, thought, maybe, talk, work, run, settings, noticed, jump, calm, rage, blink, eye, okay, sleeping, Kay, told, comes, know, Tells, things, Detective, Eckhart, come, ask, shot, want, kill, called, night, party, fight, Randy, Wanted, talk, told, meet, special, place, cabin, beach, came, barefoot, liquor, breath, wanted, comfort, touch, let, skin, like, written, went, kiss, started, laughing, got, angry, given, shared, wanted, stop, calm, rage, blink, eye, Remember, Yes, Like, want, summer, house, Kgun, Lake, going, write, novel, famous, detective, goes, bad, kidding, coming, sure, tell, truth, kind, fun, Going, station, meeting, nice, people, Talking, miss, especially, like, new, detective, Detective, Burr, liked, real, vitality, visit, backup, following, procedure, know, partners, Bound, secret, police, bad, Wild, card, jammed, time, remember]",0.08955223880597014,0.0845771144278607,0.024875621890547265,0.0945273631840796,0.1044776119402985,0.12437810945273632,0.24875621890547264,0.05472636815920398,0.03980099502487562,0.15920398009950248,"[-3.02588164e-02  1.11175434e-01 -1.89639037e-01 -1.55844436e-02

Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them. Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot. Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down. Somebody got wind of it, killed them all. Dudley. Dudley's guys. It all keeps coming back to Dudley. Let's just kill them. For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way.

44,EXLEY,L.A. Confidential,1997,False,"What's on the call sheet Decorated I get the idea.  You got a description To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice. The youngest applicant by eight years. I was thinking Detective Bureau. You're wrong. Dudley, we've been over this. I... No. No. No. No. I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father. All right, men.  You've had your fun.  Time to break it up. What's going on I have the report right here. They're home with bruises and muscle pulls  Oh shit... Stop, Officer!  That's an order! You're going in my report!  All of you! Let me out!  That's an order! Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned The public demands justice, sir. This was a fullfledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself protect the department. White's a mindless thug. I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right. Detective lieutenant. I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective. Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him. Yes, Dudley.  I am. That's right. Throwing me You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty. What about you You're just a thug, White.  That's all you'll ever be. His blood's always up. Don't get sick!  Not in here! Sir, I took the call.  It's my case. Yes, I do, sir. Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight. We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a latemodel purple Mercury Coupe. It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best.  So tell me... Is that Dick Stensland Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence. Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people. We know this is difficult.  Just take your time and look again. When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts He might as well have put a bounty on them. I'll take those odds. Take off.  We got it from here. L.A.P.D. Think of us as backup. Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.  End of story. Damnit... Glasses. Shut up, Carlisle! Casitas Youth Camp... Coates twentytwo, a boxer... Manager saw them burning clothes. I'll break them, sir. They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson They say Robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second.  Do you believe that You're twentytwo, aren't you, Ray Did one of the officers work you over a little You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twentytwo, right Just getting my facts straight. Twentytwo makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him. Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you Sugar, Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas.  You couldn't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you.  He said they call you 'Sugar' because you gave it out so sweet. Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you I heard you like to shoot dogs. Oh  you feel that way about people, too Ray, we got the shotguns. Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes. You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good. Were you on hop  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray Where do they get their stuff Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one. I'm going to take a break. You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about.  You got a big guilty sign around your neck. Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper.  I want him primed. Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off.  He said the Nite Owl was your idea.  You want to tell me about it I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk and I think I can save your life. Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months. Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.  It can be you or it can be Ray. Larry, he called you queer.  He said at Casitas you took it up the ass.  He said Why'd you burn the clothes Hurt who  Was she a hooker Hurt who She may still be alive, whoever she is. Where's the girl  Did you kill her You wanted Larry to lose his cherry, but things got out of hand.  Is that right Kick loose, Jones.  I know you made her bleed, but that doesn't mean you killed her. If that girl's alive, you've still got a chance on this one. You think Where is she now Did you leave her someplace Did you sell her out  Give her to some of your buddies  Tell me where the girl is! Officer White, put down that weapon and A naked guy with a gun  You expect anyone to believe that How's it going to look on your report You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard. 'Give me one to feed the D.A.... Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  Runs a holeup for parole absconders.' Anyone seen Jack Vincennes Nobody move! I need the girl to give me a chronology of events.  No details. Just times. But No.  that won't be necessary. There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy Clean Until he gunned down six people. Then who phoned in the report The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case What are you talking about Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions. Officer White out loud Under the house. I don't doubt it  Oh, God. I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk only to me on this one. I need to speak to you. I want you to follow Bud White. It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently. Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night You make a mistake Listen, I think I made a mistake, too. Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings It's a simple question. Rollo Tomasi. Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality. Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack Why'd you become a cop I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing. I want to do it right. A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White. What's that for Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on What's FleurdeLis Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato. Check the bar.  I got the restaurant. Since when do twobit hoods and hookers give out autographs L.A.P.D.  Sit down. LANA Who in the hell do you think you are Take a walk, honey, before I haul your ass downtown. LANA Who in the hell do you think are ! Shut up.  Being cut to look like Lana Turner doesn't mean you are Lana Turner. What How was I supposed to know Bud White's been here Is the Veronica Lake lookalike one of your whores What's her name Why's she seeing Bud White Anything else you want to add before I talk to her Not good enough. This is Exley. Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him. I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley. Really  What did White say Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. Scotch. Why Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken. How was I You sound like you mean it. How about White I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff I'll take your word for it. I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for. You cut to the heart of things, don't you  What about Lynn Bracken  She going to be a hooker all her life Some reality. Why not You're the first person to ever call me tough. You, me and White, huh No... Where'd the tip come from I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything.  Start with the I.D. on the corpse. We got a dead excop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead excop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for excops. Anything So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43. Where are the police academy files Just show me where they are! Why She told you Who told you  Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks. Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way back.  Stensland, too. Think, goddamn you.  Think... Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to Stensland and Buzz Meeks .  Twoman triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus. The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin. It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle. They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them. It's Dudley for the Nite Owl. Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett. What Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules. With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a goodcopbadcop. You expecting problems whisper What I don't think his excop did him much good. It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running. We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett. Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends. I got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff's department.  West Hollywood station.  He can be at her house in two minutes. Is she inside Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one sees her unless I okay it. Ellis Loew. Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this. Ask for Captain Dudley Smith. We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut. I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twentyfour hours a day I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour. None.  Call it a hunch. Without what, his smearing yours first  What's he got on you, Loew  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it. I don't know how. Bud... What's Dudley's scheme Not everybody .  You tipoff Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time. We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn. You want to talk to her Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this. Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did. I don't know if it's pathetic or romantic, but when this is all over I'd like to see you again. Me  You called it.  I got a message that... Shit... Come on. You figured this was a setup And you showed up anyway You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father. We got him! I'm thinking we might walk away from this. Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland. Why And now you'll provide them. No . Something like that. Yes.  I do. HushHush is delivered.  The headline  Actor Reynolds That's it.  That's the whole story. I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades. Where will you go When Where is he Thanks for the push. You just did what you did.  No rank, no glory. From me to you.  It'll mean something if it's yours.

45,LYNN,L.A. Confidential,1997,False,"A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watereddown stuff you push on Errol Flynn. Before five tomorrow. Merry Christmas yourself, Officer . It's practically stamped on your forehead. We just call him Buzz. It's not what you think. But it's nice to know you care. Hello I'm sorry, but I'll make it up to you.  I promise. I've been expecting you.  Pierce called.  Told me what happened to Sue. It's Officer White, isn't it Can I get you a drink I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean Of course I am.  What kind of question is that No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you Yes.  But do you know That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating. I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today. Like I said we were friendly, not friends. Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little. He's waiting for you to mention mention. It's Lynn. I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White You say 'fuck' a lot. There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job Do you enjoy it Did they deserve it today But you did it anyway. Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute. He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print. It was nice meeting you, Officer. Are you asking me for a date or an appointment If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I Did you forget some I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White. You should see yourself.  You look like you're ten years old. If you'd called first, I wouldn't look this ridiculous. You're wondering if Patchett told me to be receptive. It doesn't matter.  I like you, Bud.  I really do. It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... Where'd this come from So you saved her. Do you like being a cop, Bud You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want. I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about. He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it Trying to measure up to a ghost. He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink I'm curious about you. Because Bud hates you more than he loves me. It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete. The way you've underestimated Bud White Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best. The silver screen's loss is your gain. You want to know what Bud's like in bed I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him. I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake lookalike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it. Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous. I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality. No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is. Because you'll use it against me. Won't you You're tougher than Bud thinks you are. Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself. Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside. Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast. He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating. Come in out of the rain, Bud. We talked. In the morning. I thought I was helping you.  I thought If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake. I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who. I know how he feels. Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is. Right now, before I back down. We should go now. Some men get the world.  Others get exhookers and a trip to Arizona.

46,DUDLEY,L.A. Confidential,1997,True,"Drop the formalities it's Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley. Excellent.  How's this The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element.  Our vigilance will not be diminished. That's Smith with an S. This way, gentlemen. This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job. I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact. Feel free to get a feel for the place. A word with you, lad. To the memory of your father. The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time. That was his favorite toast. I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twentythree. You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund. Am I...  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment Answer yes or no. Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...  Yes or no, Edmund. Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau. At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them. Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer. No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat. You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department So be it. Sergeant, we'll get right to it. Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia. John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now. Lad, may I have a word with you Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables. He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective. Call me Dudley. Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell And for good reason judging from what I know of your background. It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. They're yours.  Take them. Four of the defendants recanted their testimony. I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the goahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. Will you work for me How what, Wendell You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time. Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it. It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command. Why Get on it. With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime free. The Chief wants it to stay that way, Edmund.  The means are not for the weakhearted. Come, Wendell, you can do better than that. We know all that, lad.  Tell us, who do these shooters work for We want you to go home. Uncuff him, Michael. Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re education in the ways of polite society. It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test. Sit him back down. Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here. 'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it.  Six victims.  One of them, one of our own  Dick Stensland. As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular.  In the wrong place at the wrong time. Robbery looks like the motive.  We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen.  We do have one hot lead, so listen well.  Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color.  An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 300 A.M. The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County.  Fifty twoman teams will shake three names apiece.  Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad. Ed, I want confessions. I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of. Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud. This one's on the verge. Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl. You've got it, Wendell. We're going through the front. Your father would've been proud. There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little selfdoubt It's natural.  Just keep it inside.  Between you and you. Where did you intend to start. Prostitution  Gambling Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This is the City of Angels and you haven't got any wings. John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad. Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara. A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him What's this all about, lad You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice. Have you discussed this with anyone else, John Not even with Exley Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all. Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi Anonymous.  Probably nothing. You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad. You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell. It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes But you were business associates Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett. Wendell.  I want full and docile cooperation on all topics. And Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships. And Wendell! I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China. Hushhush... I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history. A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over... Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective. We're policemen! Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives. Why not, lad  Absolute justice Really Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects

47,SOMERSET,Se7en,1995,False,"No... no.  There's nothing wrong. Soon. Everything here still seems... seems so strange to me.  All this. That is exactly what I mean.  Strange. Did his wife confess  Did she actually speak the words Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here. Did their son see it happen I heard you brought in two smalltimers last night. Since we are just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and talk for awhile.  That way we can... I meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... Why are you here All this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from Philadelphia to here.  It's the first question that pops into my head. You think you know me  You just met me two minutes ago. It's very simple.  You've come from the City of Brotherly Love to the City of Brotherly Hate, detective.  I've never seen it done that way. Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen. But, you've never worked homicide in this city. Well, please do me the favor of remembering it. At what time did you confirm the death Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you again after we've had a look. I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into Drop it.  We have more important concerns just now, don't we Not yet. If you could... spare me the anecdotes for now.  Leave the refrigerator open for the light. What do you smell  Other than him, and all the food. A bucket. Is there any blood in it Guessing this early is useless. Well, three is certainly a crowd in here.  And, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence. Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors. Send one forensic in on your way out. Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills. No. Yes.  Impressive work. I know it.  That doesn't mean... I made a decision, because I have to worry about the integrity of the scene. When I'm on scene, I'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.  I'm there to do the work. You've worked Homicide for four years, or for five years... Don't count the halfyears, unless you want to sound like a rookie. Doctor, are you saying this man... ate till he burst Those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun. He was forcefed... till his body started rejecting the food.  He literally couldn't eat another bite. His throat was swollen from the effort. He was bleeding internally. He must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die. Same color and texture. Always look for one thing to focus on. There's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility. Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally Milton. It's a quote from a book.  Milton's Paradise Lost. One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go free. This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife.  And he was given a long time... to decide. Where to make the first cut  There's a gun to your head... but, what part or parts of your body are expendable Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle.  But, he went into shock.  Bled to death. Look at both killings together.  This murderer is an artist. He uses colors and symbols.  He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition.  It's been premeditated so meticulously... and this is just the beginning. The rats and the pennies.  The circle and the triangle on the wall.  There's something about them... these murders mean something. I need you to know... I want us reassigned.  We're declining this case. This cannot be my last duty here.  It's going to go on and on. Everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible. Also... I don't think this should be Mills' first case. It would be too much for him, too soon. I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll fix up my house. I don't know what you mean. Did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk And how he was mugged  And, his wallet was taken, and his watch.  Then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not far from here. I have no understanding of this place. Yes.  You're absolutely right. Put a little elbow grease into it! Sorry.  Last one. How is she  Have you seen her recently Good for her. I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally getting out. He became a realist. Not that I don't appreciate your recent artistic endeavors... but, what happened to the painter I used to know They're not for sale. What is it  What's the murderer trying to say What picture is he painting Where The seven deadly sins. Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth. Seven deadly sins. And, it's two down... five to go. Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I mean. Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I could leave these books for him. Thank you. Could you tell him... tell him this is his reading assignment.  It's urgent. I've marked the most important pages. I do have to get going. Really  Good things, I hope. Really I'm going to leave him a list of specifics.  It all relates to the case he's on. To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills... Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what you could call fast friends. I doubt your husband shares that opinion. He's a good cop.  He just... I hear you and he were high school sweethearts. It's rare these days... that kind of commitment. Well... this will only take a minute. My future. Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to him then. How's it coming It's your name on the door. Hello Yes, well... I appreciate the thought, but... I... Well, I guess I'd be delighted to. Thank you... goodbye. I'm invited to have a late supper with you and your wife.  And I accept. Tonight. I was close.  It just didn't happen. Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable.  Just ask your husband. Too long.  Much too long. What do you think of our fair city You'll get used to it pretty quickly. There are things in any big city that stand out at first.  But... I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment. All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day. What about them I read.  Remember reading  What's the last book you read, Mills I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone named... Dino. No connection between the two victims No witnesses of any kind In this city, minding your own business is a perfected science. At the precinct, Sunday nights, they offer a public crime prevention course. And, the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream help if you're in trouble.  Scream fire. Because people don't want to get caught up in anything.  But, a fire... that's entertainment.  They come running. The Sun in Splendor with the Eye.  It refers to God the father, and to Saint Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas wrote a summary of theology, Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about the seven deadly sins. Now, what else have you got So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town on Sunday. This is his wife And, if it's a threat This is the one thing. It's like he's preaching. The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, as a learning tool.  The sins distract man from true worship.  True faith. Seven Terraces of Purgation. Because there's creativity in the mix. Consider these books as the murderer's inspiration.  Or aspiration. He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work. For all of us to see and learn from. These murders are like forced attrition. Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. When Mr. Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment I thought you said she found the body. When she got back from a business trip. Maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet. He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work. For all of us to see and learn from. These murders are like forced attrition. Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. When Mr. Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment I thought you said she found the body. When she got back from a business trip. Maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet. Have her look one last time. This has got to be it. It has to be.  He changed the wire to rehang it. Bear with me. Shut up and wait! Call the print lab.  Now. No.  I have not. It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe he wants us to help him stop. You really meant what you said to Mrs. Gold.  You really believe we'll get him, don't you I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so far gone from that. All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence... all the pictures, statements.  Write everything down and note what time things happened. We take it all, make a nice, neat pile and file it away.  Just in case it's ever needed in a courtroom. I've seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times. In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if every un revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living. Does not seem like our killer, does it Zero does possess the requisite degree of insanity... but, he doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Zero could ever conceive of. Why would we No.  Never in twentyfour years.  I took my gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it.  I never fired it.  Not once. And How did the firefight end How was it I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that, in order to live in a city, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, to survive. Sloth... it's sloth. Someone call an ambulance. The first photo... it's dated one year ago.  Almost to the day. The way this has gone, I didn't think it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. Listen... we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here.  We have to keep focusing on the small details. He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful. Are you listening to me! They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.  You can hate them, but you better give them something, or they'll make it all up. Oh, it's alright.  It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions. I needed for you to see them. If this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church... if he collects religious art from a certain period, I want to know.  I have to narrow it down. In the murders, gluttony is green. Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo. Where do I look  If the colors changed so often Problems Father Tell me what happened. What abuse Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd like to ask you a few questions, if it's alright I want to ask you about the seven deadly sins. Yes, father. I don't... I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do you understand what I'm saying I'm just looking. Is this still the Lord's house And, even if Father Stone was guilty of everything... if he was hurting children here  It's still the Lord's house No. That's not what I've given up on. So, what is this Dario!  Come here. According to the Father, this orphanage wasn't around for more than five or six years in the late fifties.  So, I want someone to go to the Department of Child Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the records on this place.  Understand Get a list of every child who attended this orphanage before it shut down.  Get it on my desk within the hour. You thought of this all by yourself This was your brainstorm It's a pleasant surprise. I guess not. No... I don't see any Ramirez. No. No. That's not what you think it is. That's right.  Let me have it. How do you know Christ... it's like a sick joke. There is one boy here.  He was abandoned... no one knew who his parents were, so he was named at the orphanage... John Doe.  It's his legal name. We're focusing. We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions. Try to get a feeling whether we should keep tabs on him. Yeah.  I think so. Jesus Christ. I know. We need to put more men on this. We've got about five thousand notebooks in this room.  And, as near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages. What sick, silly puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on.  What fun we have, dancing around, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what God intended. On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.  He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things.  I tried to be accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality.  I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I threw up all over him.  And I couldn't stop myself from laughing. No dates indicated.  They're placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  He describes a scab on his arm for five pages, then writes about existential philosophy on the next. It's just his mind poured out on paper. You can see what he did. She had the telephone. Or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness. Tracy I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found this place.  I almost should have expected to run into you here, knowing that you teach English. This is why I moved into this neighborhood. Same here. You can stay and browse a little longer, can't you  I mean... I... I hardly know anyone I can talk about books with anymore.  I'd appreciate the company. The irony is, that after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue Morgue. My mother would give him hell... because I was young, and he was keeping me up till all hours, giving me nightmares. One birthday, he gave me a hardcover book called The Century of the Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate.  Because it was real, and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... was incredible to me. Okay, thanks. I'll give you a ride. I have to insist.  If your husband found out I let you ride the subway at this hour he'd tear my head off. I mean, literally. It's a hard place, Tracy. You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy, like tonight, there are small pockets of sanity.  Some bars and bookstores. Museums.  Several last vestiges of civilization. You can always look into the private schools.  You'll find something. You're too hard on yourself, Tracy. It's okay to hate this city.  It's natural.  But, there is a bright side in all this.  There is.  You want to hear it I can't think of another place that needs education more than this city. And you're a teacher.  You can make a difference in a few people's lives. It's a very good thing. Goodnight. I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry. Nothing.  Sorry. Apples on the floor.  Original sin. Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard part.  I think lust is the most prevalent sin, even more than greed. Bright red. Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red light district. It would be fitting. What was this job you did for him You built this for him  You built this Where was the girl Where was the prostitute Who tied her down  You or him There's not going to be a happy ending. It's not possible. No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against the bad guys in this city. You tell me... when you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or, a wife murdered her husband in cold blood... and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won Where's the victory If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it turned out he was the devil... if it turned out he was literally Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do these horrible things, right!  But, this is not the devil.  It's only a man. Who are you fighting for  People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers. There's no one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live anymore where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue. Wrong!  I sympathize completely. Because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you go insane.  It's easier to smoke crack, and not worry that your wife and kids are starving to death. And, it's so much easier to bear a child till that child finally shuts up, because it takes so much work to love. And, if you bothered to think about the abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad. No, I am not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  Where Ignorance isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival. People who are in arguments over their heads always use meaningless slogans. But, life doesn't conform to analogies. That part of me is dead. Hello. Is everything alright I don't think that's a good idea. David doesn't know about this  You haven't told him I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the one to talk to about this. I... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage.  And, there was a baby.  A long time ago.  Things were good.  And I got up one morning, and I went on a case... a murder, like any other.  Except it was my first since hearing about the baby.  And, I felt this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I looked around and I thought, how can I raise a child here  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have children,  And, over the next few weeks... I convinced her... I mean, I wore her down... slowly. I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive it was the right thing to do.  But, there's never a day that goes by that I don't wish I had decided differently. If you... if you decide not to have the baby... if that's what you decide, then never tell Mills you were pregnant. I mean that.  Never tell. Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether. But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him that exact second.  And, spoil that kid every chance you get. That's all the wisdom I can share with you, Tracy.  I barely know you. Probably not.  But, it's probably better that way. I've decided... I want to stay on, till this is over.  Till either it's done, or we can see it will never end. One of two things is going to happen. We're either going to get John Doe... or, he will finish his series of seven, and he'll never be found. I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor. No.  I wasn't sure at all. As soon as this is over, I'll be gone. Be careful! I don't believe it. Because he is John Doe, by choice. Slow up.  You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop. John Doe's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right  But, can you even conceive of what might happen next  I mean, can you tell me how he's going to go about it I can tell you this I recognize his lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's the one who kept Zero out of prison. We'll wait for John Doe's plea. 1 gluttony x       5 lust x 2 greed x          6 wrath 3 sloth x          7 envy 4 pride x This is all part of his game plan. Hold on... just a minute. If he were to plead insanity... this conversation is admissible.  The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea... Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out of the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down. If John Doe's head splits open, and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it. No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice. What is it Please... Give me a break. Ready I'm here. If we're on the bridge, you keep your distance.  You hear me Cross the river before us if necessary. A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out now.  You're right in front of us. You stay out of this unless I call you in, California.  Understand Mills! Christ. Mills!  Pull out! Pull out now! Where's David Tell me what you want. I want to see him.  Show me Mills. You're a murderer.  That's all.  The only way you've distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality. You're killing innocent people, and I should admire you  You're doing it because it gives you pleasure.  That's the only purpose... your sick pleasure. All you've done is cause more misery and pain!  You've given people all the more reason to believe there is no God! Do you really think I'm just going to let this happen!  You think I'm going to let him die Let him go, God damn you. Alright... you don't have to do this, John.  You've already made your point. You're insane.  That's why. Don't do this! No! David, get out! No! David... David  Please... You. I wish I could say something... Something to... I don't know... We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit. Take care of yourself. Take care of the baby. Goodbye, Tracy. Oh... man...

48,MILLS,Se7en,1995,False,"Is that your car, man Does that car belong to you You're telling me that's your car Uh... Lieutenant Somerset I'm David Mills... your new partner. I'm a little thrown.  I just finished orientation at central, and they dumped me off down here. Yeah.  Two real idiots. Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you. Seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing. I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know what I mean I... I don't follow. I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or... at least the same reasons you used to have for being here... ...before you decided to give up. Maybe I don't understand the question. I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. You know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go. I wasn't standing around Philly guarding the fucking Liberty Bell. I realize that. Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him You didn't check vital signs No.  The point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs. Listen, Godzilla... And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut. Fine... for now. I guess that makes it homicide. Still, he could have tied himself in. To make it look like murder. I don't see any blood or bruises yet. No wounds.  You see anything I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right So, this guy took this big knife... and he held it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into the wall.  Cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back. Except, he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it. Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this malebonding thing going.  My mistake. I don't know... there's something. It's vomit. It's a bucket of vomit. Can't tell by looking. You think he was poisoned And, those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor There's room.  Light's the problem. Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on this. We need to chat. You just hold them up.  I do all the work. You've seen my files... seen the things I've done So, what's your problem  I've done my time on doortodoors, and walking a beat. I did all that shit a long time ago. That's bullshit. The badge in my pocket says detective, just like yours.  I've been Homicide for four and a half years. Oops.  My hand slipped. You fucked me over today, and you know it.  You know it. Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off. Please, do me the favor of remembering that. It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly better than yesterday.  I think Somerset and I came to a small understanding... ...about this big. He is that, if nothing else. We started a big homicide case today. I'll spare you the grisly details. There are a lot of frightening people in the world. Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight tonight.  Okay  Can we just go one night without fighting about something We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed to pack it all in and go back  How are we going to do that There's a lot of pressure on me... I... I know.  I know... Fuck you. Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm walking here. I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I never had a chance to actually do that. But, we can start the argument right back up where we left off, right What Goodnight. I can see what you're pointing at... He died by eating Plastic So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave him a choice eat, or get your head blown off. So, the killer held a bucket under him. You kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon. Somerset, look here. If this is what that is... it doesn't make sense.  It doesn't figure. How are pieces of the floor going to get in the guy's stomach Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light. This is not good. What A pound of flesh. This is his stuff, captain.  I've been out in the cold most of the day. What! Can I just say something This is not my first case, fuckhead! Give it to me, then.  There's nothing that says I have to fly with him. If Somerset wants out, fuck him. Could we talk about this in private Thank you, sir. He must have left us another puzzle to solve... somewhere. Christ... circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes . You tell 'em boss.  Detective David Mills is a wonderful human being... Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing freak, motherfuck... Good work, Officer.  Good work. Thank God. Great. 2 greedx       6 pride 3 sloth          7 lust 4 envy Detective Mills here. Honey, I asked you not to call unless... What... why  Okay... okay.  Hold on. It's my wife. Well How's that Tracy.  What the hell No argument. It takes time to settle in. This real estate guy... a real scum, brought us to see this place a few times.  And, it was nice enough, and the price was right.  I was thinking it was nothing, but I started to notice, he kept hurrying us along.  I mean what could it be  Why would he only show it like five minutes at a time, before he'd hustle us out the door Oh, fuck. That's weird.  It's unAmerican. What about sports You go to movies at least. T.V. Guide. Excuse me. I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen Green Acres. You've never seen The Odd Couple  The Flintstones We think he acted like he was delivering a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's building says he doesn't even look at anyone who goes in anymore. None.  Which I can't understand.  It's like this guy's invisible. Which saint is he Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but... it's my case. The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's blood. She was away on business.  She got back the day he was killed.  If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned her about ten times. We put her in a safe house. I know. Like in these paintings, and in Dante's Purgatory, right  But, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy climb that big mountain... Anyway... pride comes first, not gluttony.  And in all the paintings, the sins are in a different order.  I can't find a pattern. He's punishing these people. What  Forced what Because someone's holding a gun on you. She didn't find it.  The door to the apartment was open and a neighbor... No.  She got back after you and I had already been there. What Please, look for anything strange or out of place.  Anything at all. I need your help if we're going to get the guy who killed your husband.  If there's anything in these pictures... Are you absolutely sure He's punishing these people. What  Forced what Because someone's holding a gun on you. She didn't find it.  The door to the apartment was open and a neighbor... No.  She got back after you and I had already been there. What Please, look for anything strange or out of place.  Anything at all. I need your help if we're going to get the guy who killed your husband.  If there's anything in these pictures... Are you absolutely sure We have to show her those.  There might be something she's missing. What is it What Nothing. It's nothing. Give it up.  The killer didn't paint the fucking thing. He fucked us. Son of a bitch! What Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding. Talk to me. Listen, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this  Been involved in anything remotely like this Who the hell knows  There's plenty of schizoids out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  With tiny voices whispering nasty things in their ears. And you don't So, tell me what you think we're doing. You're unbelievable.  In my entire life, you're the oldest man I've ever met. I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hickboy you seem to think I am. Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we were getting somewhere. And, don't try to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play well in a courtroom. You tell me.  I'm new in town. We'll tag along. Satisfy our curiosity You ever take one I pulled it once, fired it once.  I never took a bullet. It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty shaky going in.  When we busted the door, looking for a junkie, the fucking guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the arm.  He went flying... like in slow motion. I remember riding in the ambulance.  His arm was like... a piece of meat.  I thought, it's just his arm.  But, he bled to death right there anyway. Well, I was doing really good in Philly up till then.  Lots of simple busts. I've always had this weird luck... but, this was wild. I got that fuck with one shot... right between the eyes.  And the next week, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, the whole nine yards. I expected it to be bad, because I heard about other guys.  You know... I took a human life.  But, I slept like a baby that night. Sounds like he knew what he was talking about. Get up now, motherfucker!  Now! I said get up, Sleepyhead! Holy shit. It's him.  It's Zero. Hey, California.  Get your people out. Somerset, you... you better look here. All pictures of Zero tied to the bed. The last one's dated three days ago. What's this A urine sample... hair sample... fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at us. I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him. I don't know about you, Somerset, but I feed off my emotions. I hear you. What the fuck are you doing That doesn't mean anything.  This is a closed crime scene now! Get the fuck out of here! How do those cockroaches get here so quick I'm sorry... I just... He hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way There's no way he'll survive There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A paralyzed man with no tongue. Bring me everything as soon as it's transcribed. Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light. Milton. Our guy's a bookworm, right  And, I know it's a long shot, but you have to give a picture id and current phone bill to get a library card.  Hey... I made two separate lists of books.  One relating to the sins... Dante's Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The Dictionary of Catholicism... all the religious stuff.  The second list was books about torture methods, mass murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever our killer might study to do the things he's done.  Whatever his other interests are. Alright.  Everything at the library goes into a computer.  So, you can get in the system and crossreference... Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory, call number eightfiveoneD, and... The Biography of the Marquis de Sade, ninetytwo SADE.  Put those books in the system, and the computer can give you the name of anyone who's ever taken out both those books.  And, it doesn't just give you their name and address, it gives you a complete history of their library reading habits. If somebody's out there reading Paradise Lost and studying The Life and Times of Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them. Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to believe I'm not as stupid as I look. Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez. Elinski.  Dennis Elinski. Atwater  Paul Atwater. Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books this guy's been taking out... Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers... Of Human Bondage . Holy shit.  Somerset... The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas.  Right Fuck... he used a false name. His library card lists him as Jonathan Doe.  John Doe. What What are you talking about It's impossible odds that this is him. I know, I know.  On one little thing. I'm not complaining.  I'll follow anything we get and I'll take it any way we can get it. I'll do the talking, right  Let me practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe, but, are you by any chance a serial killer  Oh... oh, you are  Well, come with us then, if you don't mind. Somerset! It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this fucker! Are you alright  Are you okay Give us first crack at it. Somerset! Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it. The pass is a fake... we had him. We were that close to him. Make sure it gets around. Keep looking. You know, you're right.  I don't believe it.  Keep looking. I'm working on it, alright.  What have we got. Then, he must write about the murders. You were right.  He is preaching. Hello... hello Okay, John.  Let's... Pride.  Just like in the painting. Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He put the noose around her neck and stood her on the chair. Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be mutilated. It won't be for long, honey.  I swear. This is just till this is over. I'm sorry. There's two people in that painting. So, maybe he's planning to kill two people this time.  Maybe. What's wrong this morning Lust is next.  Lust is sex. Adam and Eve. Sex, sex, sex.  Fucking sex. Lust is red. Blood red. Red blooded.  Red head.  Dead. That would make sense. You're damn right it would. It was definitely him  You're positive Oh, fuck... If we get him, I'll be happy enough. How can you say that  Especially after today If I thought like you, I'd have slit my wrists a long time ago. You do your job.  Follow the law and do the best you can.  It's all there. Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while!  Huh  You make these speeches... like you know everything there is to know. You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead You think you're toughening me up Well, you're not! You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying to fight. What the fuck is wrong with you, huh What burnt you out You're so much better than everyone, right  No one's worthy of you. You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're... Listen to yourself.  You say, the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people.  But, if you're not part of the solution... You're already here, and you've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters. Fuck you.  You want me to agree with you.  Yeah, you're right, Somerset, this place is fucked.  Let's go live in a fucking log cabin!  Well, I don't agree with you.  You're quitting, and it makes me sick.  Cause, you're the best I've ever seen. Thanks for the beer. I love you. I love you. Oh, you want to stay now You think if you stay you're doing me some big favor You knew I'd say yes. What a great big surprise that is. Mills and Somerset are on the premises. Get down on the floor. Get down!  Face down! Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch. What about the trace on his bank account  The guns When do we get to question him This doesn't make sense, captain.  He wouldn't just turn himself in! He's not finished! Somerset... help me out here. Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's fucking with us.  He's pissing in our faces again! Well... what the fuck, man No. Why me You like what you do for a living I'll do it. I'll do it.  I want to finish it. I will. I will. Listen, Somerset... we've been through a lot together.  And, I uh... I would like to make sweet love to you. Give me a kiss on the lips. Extremely. What's your story, Johnny  Who are you, really What's your deal  You seem pretty fucking nervous. You want this to go well  What is this For us to go pick up two more dead bodies, and have that be the end of it... just seems too boring for you. Wouldn't be sensational enough. What are you looking at, Johnny I remember a lot of people reading it at me when I was a kid.  I preferred the classic comic version myself. I used to have Godspell on an eight track tape.  Does that count Sit back, freak. Right, right.  I forgot.  You think these murders were for God.  Right I'm asking you seriously.  You really think what you did was God's good work Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the world do you think you are  Jesus Christ, Superstar... Alright, Somerset.  Going for a stroll. Lean on your side.  Hands behind your head and lock your fingers together. Where are we going Lead the way. So far, so good. You go first. Tell me where we're going. Slow down, Johnny.  Stop right there. I said stop! I'll blow your head off right now! What... No! Motherfucker!  No! open manhole cover Doe disappeared into. He's gone, Somerset!  He's in the water! I'm going in! I have to go in after him! Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here! Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me! I'm not going to let you win this! Somerset Motherfucker! I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm going to see you dead.

50,TRACY,Se7en,1995,False,"Thank you. He sounds interesting. It's... it's like they emptied all the insane asylums into the streets. That's what it's like.  Like they just gave up, and let everyone out. There are a lot of frightening people in this city. It seems worse than Philadelphia, because everything is pushed right up against you.  In your face. I'm not trying to start a fight. How am I trying to start a fight Do I have to act like I love this place Is that what a good wife would do And, there's a lot of pressure on me. I'm here with you. I'm not going to close my eyes and block everything out, David.  I'm not going to act like you delivered us to some sort of paradise.  I can't... Goodnight. Can I help you He's not here right now. Please, come in. David went for a walk.  To clear his head.  Oh, you can put those here. Would you like some coffee, or a drink. David should be back any minute. At least I got to meet you.  David has told me a lot about you. Oh, yes.  He said you were very smart. I think he's a bit intimidated by you. You two aren't working together anymore. Isn't that so Tracy. That's too bad. You know, Somerset, David is very... determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's not likely he'll ever be compared to Gandhi. He sees policework as a crusade.  That's what he wants it to be, and, that might sound naive, but he's made a conscious choice to be naive. Believe me, his heart's in the right place. Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh  But, what girl wouldn't want the captain of the football team as their lifelong mate I guess so. Take your time. What is this You have a strange way about you, Somerset... I mean in a good way... unusual. I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair. It's just... it's nice to hear a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're acting like a homosexual.  That's how he is. I suppose not. Why aren't you married, Somerset It surprises me you're not married.  It really does. How long have you lived here You take the bad with the good, I suppose.  It's... it's... Subway train.  It's right below us It'll go away in a minute. We found out the first night. I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't have a television. Somerset.  How are you It's so huge.  It's amazing. Don't you love the smell of all the old books.  It smells like... like... I guess just old books, but, I love it. Forgive me.  No matter how often I see guns, I can't get used to them. If David's going to be back home soon, I should get back. I hope you'll come to dinner another night.  Before you leave. Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. David's going to wonder where I am. No.  Please, don't bother. You've lived here for so long, Somerset. You know this city.  I... When David and I lived in Philadelphia, we could afford to live on the outskirts.  But now... I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I feel sick and... I hate it. I've visited so many of the schools, looking for work, you know.  And, the conditions are... horrible.  I can't believe how bad it is. Children shouldn't have to grow up here. Oh, God, yes.  Please. Goodnight, Somerset. I... I better go. I know. I know.  It can't be helped. 2 greed x         6 envy 3 sloth x         7 wrath 4 pride x David David Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy. Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could you meet me somewhere.  To talk. I need to talk to someone, Somerset. You're the only friend I have here.  I don't know anyone else. I just can't think straight.  I don't know why I called you, except I can't stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I had to get it out... and I can't tell David yet.  Not yet. I want to have children.  But... Somerset... Will I see you again, before you leave I'll be okay. I'll write to you when we get there.

51,JOHN DOE,Se7en,1995,True,"I admire you, David.  Imagine my surprise on finding you at my doorstep. I admire you more and more every day. No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk. I suppose you found the painting and the photos.  This is just as well.  Now we all know we've all seen each other. I mean what I say.  I do admire you. Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen hundred thirty.  West Eightysixth street.  Apartment sixofour. Hello, Lieutenant Somerset. I want to speak with my lawyer. It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing. I want this to go well.  It's very important to me, obviously. Turn right on this street.  Stay in the left lane. Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. Sometimes you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer... and then you get their strict attention. Looking back... at the city proper... And yet, no pillar of salt. Lost on you, isn't it  You've never read the Bible, have you, David You make me sick. Ignorant heathen. The Lord works in mysterious ways. We can walk from here. It's right this way. In here. Hello, Somerset. He's here.  With me. What do I want  The same you... I want an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put your gun on the floor and slide it all the way down here. You're an intelligent man, Somerset. You understand what you're a part of, don't you  When this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try. You know that's not true.  You know. Stay where you are! I won't deny my personal desires.  I won't. But, I don't mourn the victims in this any more than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah. Stop! Yes. How can you speak of God, Somerset When was the last time you spoke His name When did you last speak His name  Was it in prayer  Or, did you say the Lord's name after you stubbed your big toe  Or, did you use His name to curse another man The irony, David, is that you policemen and I want the same things.  But, you are so short sighted.  In this city, where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner... and in every home, we want repentance. We want good over evil.  We want values instilled in the children.  We want a world where a man or woman can lead a decent life. Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why are they nonexistent There were two men once, who had wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could see.  Beautiful gardens... the fragrance was inspiration in itself. But, both gardens were beset by problems.  Weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and diseases.  The gardens started to turn putrid.  And, one man fought to save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut the weeds, and killed the insects. Fought the diseases. That man never had a beautiful garden again. The other man plowed his garden under. He plowed it under the soil.  He started over. Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him right now. Do you think I chose this  Can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been  It's like... like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension. So that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so sweet it... it makes your bones ache to the marrow. No!  You're wrong! I was chosen.  And I've wished a thousand times I could have been a normal man.  Like David Mills, a common man... with a common life.  But, wishing that is my sin.  I can't have it and I shouldn't. I meant what I said.  I admire David Mills.  I envy David Mills. Envy is my sin.",733,"[admire, David, Imagine, surprise, finding, doorstep, admire, day, listen, talk, suppose, found, painting, photos, know, seen, mean, admire, Oh, thing, Fourteen, thirty, West, Eightysixth, street, Apartment, sixofour, Hello, Lieutenant, Somerset, want, speak, lawyer, matter, means, absolutely, want, important, obviously, Turn, right, street, Stay, left, lane, Wanting, people, pay, attention, tap, shoulder, hit, head, sledgehammer, strict, attention, Looking, city, proper, pillar, salt, Lost, read, Bible, David, sick, Ignorant, heathen, Lord, works, mysterious, ways, walk, right, way, Hello, Somerset, want, want, ending, Stay, gun, floor, slide, way, intelligent, man, Somerset, understand, finished, surreal, crystalline, reality, able, deny, matter, hard, try, know, true, know, Stay, wo, deny, personal, desires, wo, mourn, victims, mourn, thousands, died, Sodom, Gomorrah, Stop, Yes, speak, God, Somerset, time, spoke, speak, prayer, Lord, stubbed, big, toe, use, curse, man, irony, David, policemen, want, things, short, sighted, city, deadly, sin, street, corner, home, want, repentance, want, good, evil, want, values, instilled, children, want, world, man, woman, lead, decent, life, Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, fear, Lord, simple, concepts, nonexistent, men, wonderful, gardens, gardens, flowers, went, far, eye, Beautiful, gardens, fragrance, inspiration, gardens, beset, problems, Weeds, started, root, infestations, insects, diseases, gardens, started, turn, putrid, man, fought, save, garden, forget, Everyday, cut, weeds, killed, insects, Fought, diseases, man, beautiful, garden, man, plowed, garden, plowed, soil, started, Stay, Somerset, kill, right, think, chose, begin, understand, painful, existence, like, like, having, sense, heightened, comprehension, stench, street, coats, throat, like, bile, sugar, sweet, makes, bones, ache, marrow, wrong, chosen, wished, thousand, times, normal, man, Like, David, Mills, common, man, common, life, wishing, sin, meant, said, admire, David, Mills, envy, David, Mills, Envy, sin]",0.09090909090909091,0.045454545454545456,0.09740259740259741,0.09740259740259741,0.11038961038961038,0.2077922077922078,0.2727272727272727,0.1038961038961039,0.032467532467532464,0.16233766233766234,"[-3.85744146e-02  1.32188167e-01 -1.53045440e-01 -9.94951107e-02

If T.J. didn't push for me, I never would've made it. Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook. I bet you think she doesn't have a brain in her head.  I bet you think the only thing he sees in her is one incredible, dynamite body...

Take my advice, don't buy any... in tone What Your what... What are you talking about Get in bed. You got a great ass!  I love your ass  now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor. You got no idea... T.J...  Is this a joke  Are you kidding me liking what he hears Give me 20 minutes. Right behind you, T.J. Who's Joey Venza T.J. Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in. A Detective's supposed to identify himself. No, sir... That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs... Is she injured She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please. Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... We'll go slow.  Okay  We'll get through it together. I just sat and listened. I don't understand.  If there's any danger, why not just level with her... Chief Why not Patrol  They'd do just as good a job. Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all. T.J. Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess. You in this with me T.J. Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift. Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these skateboards off the goddamn kitchen floor! My special, scrambled eggs surprise. Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide. 'Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.

I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. Why I think  she's crazy. I might stop you. No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninetyseven five right Bought it. What did she say the down payment was She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.

54,CLAIRE,Someone to Watch Over Me,1987,False,"Hello, Win. companion You know Neil Steinhart They've got two monsters now.  Both boys. You didn't like him It's called solid... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win. It's terrific Win. Occasionally. I will... I promise... No. Neil, do what he says. Please. I've never seen anyone killed before. This really isn't necessary.  The security in this building is about the best in the city. Be my guest. Excuse me. This is my dressing room, and these are my clothes. firm I understand your responsibilities... but I'd appreciate you staying out of here at all times. Straight ahead. ... Detective Keegan, I hope you understand how upsetting this is ... I don't want to talk about it... ... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial... ... He killed Win... he enjoyed it... And I'm making mine. What am I supposed to do!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just  let it go away!! I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away. Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true Can we go then There's a phone in the car. Do you have another tie  Something more conservative What's the number What did he say You live in Manhattan My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School. I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary. Are you nervous Would you wrap it for me, I'll be back in a moment. Could you come with me please. Would you pick one out, please Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie. Put it on my account, please. If we had more time we'd work on the suit too. You look quite elegant, actually. You can touch me, I won't bite. I wouldn't have missed it, Tony. This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned to protect me.  Antonia Bolt... Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike Keegan... People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal. Let's get a drink. I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. I think I can probably do that on my own. Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here. Yeah. Listen, that was my fault. If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail. Lieutenant Garber says when I identify him, they're going to lock him up and throw away the key. I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him. He said he'd kill me. Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key... Hmm... Urdu and Hindi. Didn't do very well, did you You were reading my Renoir. You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir You know why they're like that... He was myopic... going blind. So, this could be your last night, huh Want to go out for a drink expression I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail... You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way That's the dumbest walk I ever saw! And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me. So it was love. And is... That's nice.  And you live in Queens  With a child, and a dog... I saw you with a dog, in my mind. But nice. You don't like him, do you Tell it like it is. He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best. I'll miss you, Mike... It was nice having you watch over me... Good night, Mike. It was my fault not Detective Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the fuss. What do you want I can't open it. You put me life in danger. And then what  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time! You told me I'm safe  I'm going for a walk in the park. I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park. Let go! I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me! More bullshit!  More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month  A couple of days Is everything all right They called here after you left... This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else... Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it. Don't you think I know what this is doing.  I know you have a wife.  I know you have a family... I'm not asking for anything.  I don't want anything... Just please hold me I'm scared... T.J. Mike... T.J. Oh, man.  I don't believe you. He's okay T.J. Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know. Oh. T.J. Tell me I'm dreamin'. You told her What do you want to do You're tired. Let me watch over you tonight... I have thought it through, Neil. Hello Mike.  Where have you been Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct. Oh God, that's great! Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular marching band.  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come... I'm going away after that, the next morning. Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found. I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. Tomorrow night.  Can you come Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really. It was something my father always liked me to do. Not if you don't want me to. Just putting in an appearance then. What a memory. Do you Let's do it. really talk Yeah. I know. I know. ... Don't explain. Long enough. To... Forget about you. I'll have to pack a lot of clothes. ... Mike. Go with him! Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make them come with you! They're assigned to me, they'll have to go if I come with you! I'm not getting out!  GO! Mike... Everyone's all right... So. I don't know... I think it's probably still a good idea. I'll miss you, Mike. speak Say goodbye. You have a weakness for Lady Cops.

66,JO,A Few Good Men,1992,False,"I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, I'd like to request that I be the attorney assigned to rep  I'd like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent That it be myself who is assigned to represent ...Good, Jo, that's confidence inspiring. Thank you, sir. Yes sir. Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on such short notice. Yes sir... This past Friday evening. Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 400 this afternoon. Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screwup. I was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red. I'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that... I be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them. Myself. Thank you, sir, I'm fine. Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir. But... not me. Sir You're the attorney that Division assigned Come in, please, have a seat... Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy And how long have you been out of law school I see. No. It's just that when I petitioned Division to have counsel assigned, I was hoping I'd be taken seriously. Have you ever been in a courtroom No. They'll need a lawyer. Dawson's family has been contacted. Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side, she hasn't been Contacted yet. Would you like me to take care of that One of the people you'll be speaking to down there is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've heard of him. These are letters that Santiago wrote in his 8 months at GITMO He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody was listening. You with me This last letter to the Naval investigative Service where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort. Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago. The victim. Yes, among other Colonel Jessep, yes, but I'm sorry You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper. You're gonna have to go deeper than just My job is to make sure you do your job. I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. Read the letters. You're not under any obligation, but I'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba. You're dismissed. Tell your friend not to get cute down there.  The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical. About being marines. Excuse me. No, thank you, I can't throw and catch things. I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey. Dawson and Downey. Dawson! Downey! Your clients! I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball. That wasn't funny. Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel I don't think you're fit to handle this defense. I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fastfood, slickass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre determined the path of least resistance. I don't think your clients murdered anybody. There was no intent. Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison. I'm gonna speak to your supervisor. Thank you. Do you know what a code red is What a pity. M.P. Officer on deck, tenhut. Hi there. Is there anyone in this command that you don't either drink or play softball with Listen, I came to make peace. We started off on the wrong foot. What do you say Friends By the way, I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for. The kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't even know why he's been arrested. You can call me Joanne. or Jo. Yes. I had authorization. Downey's closest living relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side. I gave her a call like you asked. Very nice woman, we talked for about an hour. Perfectly within my province. I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow. Commander Galloway. Thank you. Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud! Colonel. The JAG Corps can be demanding that way. Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered You planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour Wait a minute, I've got some questions. Yes I do. Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five I was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red. Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers. My point is that I think code reds still go on down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel Yes he does. Yeah, he really does. Colonel Colonel, the practice of code Reds is still condoned by officers on this base, isn't it I need an answer to my question, sir. It's me. Markinson resigned his commission. This afternoon. Sometime after we left. I already tried, I can't find him. I'm Louden Downey's attorney. Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she's known me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago. Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel. I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. So do you. Alright. Let's sort this out. There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt. Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago. Now is that true I want you to speak freely. And what happened then How long have you known about the order I'm accusing you of No deal, we're going to a jury. Why not No. Let's go in another room. Louden, everything's gonna be alright. We're gonna go into a holding room. M.P. Aye, aye, ma'am. Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely. I want you to let 'em be judged! I want you to stand up and make an argument! Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument. Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer Were daddy's expectations really that high Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win. You know they have a case. And you know how to win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate. Do you believe they have a defense You know nothing about the law. You're a used car salesman, Daniel. You're an ambulance chaser with a rank. You're nothing. Live with that. Yeah. I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first. Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean As long as we're on the subject of the doctor Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison The doctor's covering up the truth. Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway, I'm an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. I'm trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC... He resigned his commission a week ago Thursday. No, please don't put me on hold Object. Nice. And what happened after Kendrick came into your room Really! I'll give you a ride. Danny I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow. We're ready. Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt. Your Honor, we renew our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony. Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection. Exception. I got it on the record. Why do you hate them so much 'Cause they stand on a wall. And they say Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight. Not on my watch. I'm sorry to bother you, I should've called first. I was wondering if  how you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight. No. I wasn't. Do you like seafood I know a good seafood place. My third case was a Drunk and Disorderly. The trial lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people who were in the bar that night. 15 days. After that, they moved me to internal affairs. Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation. Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer. No you don't. I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you. We'll find Markinson. Where is he I want him guarded. This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My clearance code is 411273. Thank you. It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness. Damn. Yes. We're gonna win. Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now. Private Downey, why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th And why did you give him a Code Red You're gonna do fine. Absolutely. You remember the order of the questions Are you sure And you'll use small words He gets rattled when he doesn't understand something. I'm just saying go slow. Okay. And get him off as fast as you can. What Please the court, I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client. The witness has rights. Your honor Where do you think he is As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick. It didn't matter that he didn't hear it first hand. He doesn't distinguish between the two. Danny. I'm sorry. Sam and I were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses who'll talk about implied orders... or maybe we put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson. Are you drunk I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a long night's work ahead. Danny, it was just a setback. I'm sorry. But we'll fix it and then move on to Markinson. I still think we can win. Look, we'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance. 24 hours. To subpoena Colonel Jessep. Listen for a second Just hear me out You chickenshit. You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order Why! Bullshit! You could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. You had an instinct. And it was confirmed by Markinson. Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing! He told Kendrick to order the Code Red. I You put him on the stand and you get it from him! I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives. I say we hit him with the phoney transfer order. What I put it in the closet. I was tripping over it. He thinks better with his bat What's goin' on Not yet. He's on his way. Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a second How're you feeling Listen. Danny. When you're out there. If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it ...don't go for it. If you feel like... if you feel like... You could get in trouble. I'm special counsel for internal affairs, and I'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble. If you think you can't get him. Yeah. I think it doesn't matter what I think. I'm an administrator. I can't seem to defend people. He'll be here. I know, but It's not as simple as What do you say we take the rest of the day off. Go out someplace. Sam Champagne YooHoo So what's next for you Me Oh... you know... the usual. Yeah. So what do you say How 'bout a celebration Sounds good.

67,KAFFEE,A Few Good Men,1992,False,"team Alright, let's get two! Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Just look the ball into your glove. You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep your eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten. Let's try it again. Dave. You seem upset and distraught. A yardarm Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore. Let's go, let's get two! It was oregano, Dave, it was ten dollars worth of oregano. My client's a moron, that's not against the law. Ow. That had to hurt. Way to keep your head in the play, Lester. Walk it off! With what, possession of a condiment Dave, I've tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for tall time, I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss. I will get it. And if the MTD is denied, I'll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that I'm gonna file against pretrial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano. C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty. 'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years. Dave, can you play third base Excuse me, sorry I'm late. Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of you. Requested to do what What's a fenceline Teachers pet. They poisoned the rag What do they say The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the morning, sir Hi. I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet with Commander Galloway. About a briefing. I'm lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg. Going on nine months now. A little over a year. Have I done something wrong No offense taken, if you were wondering. One more, and I got a set of steak knives. I once had my drivers license suspended. Commander, from what I understand, if this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest. Sure, if you feel like it. Who hasn't I know that one. Yes. Right. Is that all Gotcha. And Santiago is... who Write that down. Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy. Twelve years. Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years. Pretty impressive, huh Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about Sure. Sorry, I always forget that. Alright, let's get tough out there! You want to suit up We need all the help we can get. That's okay, neither can they. Say again Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but I'm just not The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey. Right. I've done something wrong again, haven't I We need the practice. It was a little funny. Why You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense. Oh come on, that was damn funny. Wow. I'm sexually aroused, Commander. What are you basing this on The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad. Oh, now I see what you're saying. It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick. Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a big white house with pillars in front. I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself. Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold. I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinerg, you can sitdown. Is this your signature You don't have to call me sir. Is this your signature And you certainly don't have to do it twice in one sentence. Harold, what's a Code Red What does that mean, exactly What's a garden variety Code Red Harold, you say sir and I turn around and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, Kaffee. Garden variety typical. What's a basic Code Red What's that Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red Do you ever talk Swell. Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was there poison on it Silver polish, turpentine, anti freeze... When all of a sudden... Did anyone see you call the ambulance Were you there when the ambulance got there His mirror engaged Santiago's letter to the NIS said you fired illegally. He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move. Oh, Harold You see what I'm getting at If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red He what Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him What was your intent Train him to do what The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country We'll be back. You guys need anything Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to. I'm the only friend you've got. Sailin' Jack Ross. You think so Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin' at I want twelve. They called the ambulance, Jack. The rag was tested for poison.  The autopsy, lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the same thing Maybe, maybe not. What do you know about Code Reds You tell me. I'll talk to you when I get back. Any luck getting me replaced Commander Look, I don't Commander Joanne Jo Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission, I'll have you disbarred. Friends From where You got authorization from Aunt Ginny You got authorization from Aunt Ginny. Does Aunt Ginny have a barn We can hold the trial there. I can sew the costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge. And the hits just keep on comin'. How's it goin', Luther You gotta play 'em as they lay, Luther. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Love makes the world go round. I'll see you tomorrow, Luther. Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm not sure it was a word. Okay. She was pointing at a doorknob. Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered me twelve years. I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean I'll take it. It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight. You don't believe their story, do you You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. I'll see you tomorrow. I don't like the whites. Dramamine keeps you cool I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll help. Yeah, right. You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago. I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is. What the hell. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Camouflage jackets Good call, Sam. Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat! Nobody said anything about a boat. No. No problem. I'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all. Nobody likes her very much. Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey. This is Joanne Galloway, she's observing and evaluating Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility here whatsoever. Yes sir. He passed away seven years ago, colonel. Not at all, sir. Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. This is really a formality more than anything else. The JAG Corps insists that I interview all the relevant witnesses. Fine, sir. I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon. What'd you guys talk about What time was that meeting Sam, somebody should see about getting this stuff to his parents. We don't need it anymore. Lt. Kendrick  can I call you Jon Have I done something to offend you Sounds good. Let's move on. I'm pacing myself. Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th. On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting. Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, you should free to speak up. Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office And what happened then Santiago was set to be transferred Yeah. Alright, that's all I have. Thanks very much for your time. Thank you. No you don't. No you don't. Jo See The man was dead. Let's go. Jo She has no point. She often has no point. It's part of her charm. We're outta here. Thank you. Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that. No, he really doesn't. Yes sir. Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order. Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paper work on that kind of thing, I just need it for the file. Yeah. Thank you. Of course. Let's go. I beg your pardon Colonel Jessep... if it's not too much trouble, I'd like a copy of the transfer order. Sir. Who is it I've really missed you, Jo. I was just saying to myself, It's been almost three hours since I last saw When I'll talk to him in the morning. You tried Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation. I suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me. Splendid. Did Kendrick order the code red Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red Did he You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before Cutiepie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail. Fuck you, Harold. When And what happened then Jack! Jack!! They were given an order. This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you. Jack didn't know about the order. Because if he did and he hadn't told us, Jack knows he'd be violating about 14 articles of the code of ethics. As it is, he's got enough to worry about. God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order. That's right. And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room and specifically told them to give him a code red. Kendrick's lying. I have the defendants. Why did Markinson resign his commission You don't think I can subpoena Markinson. How much room Jo Here's the story The Goverment's offering Assault and Conduct Unbecoming. Two years. You'll be home in six months. Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest lawyer in the world. How can we ever thank you Fellas, you hear what I just said, you're going home in six months. Do what What are you talking about Did you Did she put you up to this Well zippitydoodah. You and your code plead not guilty and you'll be in jail for the rest of your life. Do what I'm telling you and you'll be home in six months. Do it, Harold. Six months. It's nothing. It's a hockey season. Speak! When Yes. Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute. You don't like me that much, do you Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter. You know, Downey worships you. He's gonna do whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code Harold It doesn't matter what I I think you'd lose. I'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold. I did everything I could. You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what I don't give a shit. M.P.! What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business. I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way down. I want to get him a new lawyer. How do I do it Then that's that. What do you want from me For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm These guys aren't the Nazis. Yeah. Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new attorney. Please, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer. Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died. You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland. It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. So please don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law. Yeah. They're not guilty. Why does a junior grade with six months experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom We'll work out of my apartment. Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before you come over tonight, pick up a carton of legal pads, a halfdozen boxes of red pens, a halfdozen boxes of black pens. Sam get a couple of desk lamps. I need you to start on a preliminary medical profile and Jo, we need all the fitness reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The only thing I have to eat is YooHoo and SugarSnacks, so if you want anything else, bring it with you. Okay So this is what a courtroom looks like. INTENT             CODE RED             THE ORDER Were you able to speak to your friend at NIS Are you Markinson Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two down. What. They were following an order, Sam. You think Dawson and Downey know it was an illegal order They're not permitted to question orders. We have softball games and marching bands. They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot. I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness. This is our defense. Intent No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order A Kendrick gave it. B They had no choice but to follow it. That's it. We're a little weak on motive. They had one. Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone. Here we go. Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information. No CliffNotes on these things Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there any other sign of external damage No scrapes No cuts Bruises Broken bones Doctor, was there any sign of violence Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam time! Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary action, or training'' as you say Please the Court, I maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of, among others, the witness. He's right, and from now on, Willy is Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him. Poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the jury. Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head, don't shift in your seat, don't scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me documents And don't wear that perfume in Court, it wrecks my concentration. I was talking to Sam. Time to go home. Try to get some sleep tonight. You're a good man, Charlie Brown. I know what you're gonna say. You don't have to. We've had our differences. I've said some things I didn't mean, you've said some things you didn't means but you're happy that I stuck with the case. And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course I'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it. You like me. I won't make you say it. Oh. Okay. Good tip. Bet your ass. We're gonna get creamed. I'll do my best. You're Aunt Ginny I'm sorry, I was expecting someone older. Last chance. I'll flip you for it. No objection. There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Let me say that again It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job. How you doin' Good. Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting But you don't believe him. Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause Thank you. Object Please the Court, is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on August 6th Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks room ten minutes after this meeting Thanks, I have no more questions. Please the Court, I understand Lt. Ross is planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify. The defense is willing to concede that all 23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and Downey's room at 1620 on August 6th. Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating. Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive. Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn. Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal. Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically Commander, is it possible What might some of those conditions be Commander, if I had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam What kind of symptoms Chest pains Shortness of breath Fatigue Doctor, is this your signature This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir. Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander 'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor No more questions, judge. Sam Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not relive it. Alright. Everybody take the night off. It's alright. We've been working 20 hour days for three and a half weeks straight. Take the night off. Go see your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do whatever it is you do when you're not here. What day is tomorrow We'll start at ten. No, I was just watching a baseball game. Jo, are you asking me out on a date It sounded like you were asking me out on a date. I've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like. Nine weeks on a D and D What was the prosecutor offering Well, you sure hustled the shit outta him. Tough to blame them. Why are you always giving me your resume I do. Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. Ross's opening speech, it was all true. I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder. Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge. Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red Have you ever received a code red And what happened Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings Was his barracks ever in disorder Did he ever fall back on a run Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red Never You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one Dawson wouldn't allow it. I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red Why didn't you Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now. Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is I don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book No more questions. Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review. I want to slam dunk this guy. Hey, Luther. Nose to the grindstone. A rolling stone gathers no moss. Ain't that the truth. Catch you tomorrow. Jesus fucking Christ!! Scared the shit outta me. Are you aware you're under subpoena What do you know Was it a code red Did Kendrick give the order Did you witness it Did you witness it! Then how do you know You know shit. We've got the transfer order. It's got your signature. I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me. Right now I'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning. The Route 23 Best Western. That's probably a good idea. Clearance code I don't have a clearance code. Do you have a He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier. That was impressive. Did you hear what I just said about the flight Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right Get it. Jo, don't get crazy about this. We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the log book's gonna say. You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are. You are like seven of the strangest women I have ever met. I have Markinson. A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink. The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney. And Jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. But in the meantime I'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun. Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something. I've been so advised. You're a lousy softball player, Jack. Batter up, J.J. Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good marine Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on Santiago. On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below Average. We appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and I think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth. Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey received three straight marks of Exceptional. Dawson received two marks of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this year, he received a rating of Below Average. It's this last report that I'd like to discuss for a moment. Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after Infantry Training School was perfect. Records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has remained a lance corporal. Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report. Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officer's Club Did you report private Barnes to the proper authorities Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority. Did you report Private Barnes to your superiors You preferred it to be handled within the unit. Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red is Have you ever ordered a code red Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days I'm sure it was lovely for Private Barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you And you did order the denial of food. Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red If I called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to Private Barnes Not so fast. Lieutenant What crime did he commit Lieutenant Kendrick Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. Lt. Kendrick Can he Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am I right You know so, don't you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red... is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again You don't have to, I'm through. What's the word Let me see that. There was no flight out at eleven o'clock. What the fuck are you trying to pull Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log! What are you telling me He fixed the log book Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I'll get the log book from Andrews. He made an entire flight disappear You're taking the stand. Thursday. There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight. A ground crew member. Someone. Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order. That'll be enough. That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough. Yes. Yes. Yes. Jo I'm gonna go slow. Alright. Joanne! He's gonna be fine. Private, I want you to tell us one last time Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th Thank you. Your witness. Don't worry about it. Maybe if we work at it we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination. Pretty much. Yeah. She's gonna make coffee. That's nice. He wasn't in his room. He wasn't even there. That was an important piece of information, don't you think Markinson's dead. You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy. laugh It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife. This guy got, into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth. Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little. Then maybe you should drink a little. Why would we want to do that What No. No. I won't listen to you and I won't hear you out. Your passion is comforting, Jo. It's also useless. Private Downey needed a trial lawyer today. It's over! What are you What does it matter I wanted the damn transfer order! What possible good could come from putting Jessep on the stand He did! Why didn't you say so! That's qreat! And of course you have proof of that. Ah, I keep forgetting You were sick the day they taught law at law school. Yes. No problem. We get it from him. Colonel, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, Judge Well, for our defendants it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee That's right  it's  a court  martial. Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt. Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Columbo School for Women. Thank you for playing Should We or ShouldWeNot Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid. Stop cleaning up. Sam. Stop cleaning up. You want a drink Is your father proud of you I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. Sam, made Law Review. He's got a big case he's making He's arguing making an argument. I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. I think he would've liked that... an awful lot. Yeah Yes he was. Would you put Jessep on the stand You think my father would've Joanne. Jo, we look ridiculous. Stop the car. Joanne. I apologize. I was angry and... I'm sorry about what I said. I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand. We have a witness. And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem. I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of you. Good. Jessep told Kendrick to order a code red. Kendrick did, and our clients followed the order. The coverup isn't our case. To win, Jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red. I think he wants to say it. I think he's pissed off that he's gotta hide from us. I think he wants to say that he made a command decision and that's the end of it. He eats breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one's gonna tell him how to run his base. Least of all the pushy broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard clown. I need to shake him and put him on the defensive. That's the plan. I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna lead him right where he's dying to go. I have no idea. I need my bat. I need my bat. I think better with my bat. Where's my bat You put it in the closet. Don't ever put a bat in a closet. Stay here, I'm going to the office for a while. Sam. I need you to do something. Is Sam here Where is he Did he got the guys I think he's gonna have his hands full today. Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are you suggesting I back off a material witness Do you think I can get him You're my hero, Joanne. From the first day, you were a lawyer. Live with that. Where's Sam Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep. Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson. And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right I'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive. I just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol. Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well Why Grave danger We have the transfer order that you and Markinson cosigned, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight off the bass Colonel, you flew up to Washington early this morning, is that right I notice you're wearing your Class A appearance in dress uniform for court today. Did you wear that uniform on the plane The defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor. I'd ask the Court for a little latitude. Colonel And you brought your dress uniform with you. And a toothbrush A shaving kit Change of underwear Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security Yes sir. Colonel Thank you. After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth, Santiago's barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried. Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki teeshirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed. I'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute. This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls. I've highlighted those calls in yellow. Do you recognize those numbers Why did you make that call, sir Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel. Colonel Is this funny, sir Do you have an answer Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you. I'm not through with my examination. Sit down. What's that Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m. Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits A and B. We believe it did, sir. then motioning to the AIRMEN Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh. Colonel, a moment ago We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago. And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted Any chance Kendrick ignored the order Any chance he just forgot about it Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, The 'old man's wrong When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him No sir. No sir. No sir. Yes sir. Crystal. Colonel, I have just one more question before I call Airman O'Malley and Airman Perez If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base But that's not what you said. You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger. You said, He was in danger. I said, Grave danger. You said I can have the Court Reporter read back your Then why the two orders Colonel Why did you No sir. You made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands. Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago shouldn't have been in any danger at all, should he have, Colonel I'd like an answer to the question, Judge. If Kendrick told his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched, then why did he have to be transferred Colonel Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't he Because that's what you told Kendrick to do. And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose. You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order You doctored the log books. I'll ask for the forth time. You ordered I think I'm entitled to them. I want the truth. Did you order the code red Did you order the code red Please the court, I suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session. The witness has rights. Jack. Don't call me son. I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy. And you're under arrest you sonofabitch. The witness is excused. SLOW DISSOLVE TO Harold, I'm sorry. Harold! You don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor. Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna testify, under oath, that they have absolutely no recollection of anything. And very handsome, too, don't you think Tell him I say Hi. Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He went to the movies on company time. What about you Just pretty much generally annoying people No. How 'bout a date. A real date. Dinner. Attractive clothes.

68,SAM,A Few Good Men,1992,False,"I think she's ready to say her first word any day now. She just looks like she has something to say. A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys. No. I have a stack of paper on my desk Doing what Kaffee'll finish this up in four days. In other words I have no responsibilities whatsoever. My kinda case. I have no responsibilities here whatsoever. Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally considered the best litigator in our office. He's successfully plea bargained 44 cases in nine months. Danny He's been in the papers lately. He's expected to be appointed Director of Operations for the National Security Counsel. Guantanamo Bay. He's a little preoccupied. The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week. About what Beautiful. On the night of August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba Why For each American sentry post there's a Cuban counterpart. They're called mirrors. The corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him. What's the code I beg your pardon When Nancy gets back, you're my witness. The baby spoke. My daughter said a word. Oh come on, it was a word. You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed, and said Pa. She did. She said Pa. That's right. Pointing, as if to say, Pa, look, a doorknob. That's what you wanted. So Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift. I believe every word they said. And I think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there. Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August. You got Dramamine Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly. I've got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good. So Four o'clock. How do you feel about that theory You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment. The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell him you want new counsel assigned. An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg. She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we're not gonna find him. She said I could be Markinson and you wouldn't know it. No. I was wondering, now that Joanne's working on this... I was wondering if you still need me. An illegal order. It doesn't matter if they know, any decent human being would've refused to Then what's the secret What are the magic words I give orders every day, and nobody follows them. Did you get any dumplings What about motive Cartons 3 and 4. No. No. No. You mean other than the dead body Don't ask the last question. His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth. What time is it See you in court. I strenuously object Is that how it works Objection. Overruled. No, no, no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, well if you strenuously object, let me take a moment to reconsider. You also got it in the jury's head that we're afraid of the doctor. You object once so they can hear you say he's not a criminologist. You keep after it and it looks like this great cross we did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks. It's the difference between paper law and trial Christ, you even had the Judge saying Stone was an expert! I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet you tonight. They beat up on a weakling, and that's all they did. The rest is just smokefilled coffeehouse crap. They tortured and tormented a weaker kid. They didn't like him. And they killed him. And why Because he couldn't run very fast. I apologize, I, Saturday. Why do you like them so much Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday. We need the Tower Chief's Log for GITMO. This is the tower chief's log for that night. Jessep was telling the truth. The six a.m. flight was the first plane out. Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day A kid from the ground crew isn't gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago. Look, we're all a little Yeah. Don't do this to yourself. Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on your father in college He was one of the best trial lawyers ever. And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick. No. With the evidence we've got Not in a million years. But here's the thing and there's really no way of getting around this  neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So there's only one question. What would you do What's the transfer order without a witness A dead witness. Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound. And you think you can got him to just say it That's it That's the plan You're gonna trip Jessep and he's gonna confess. And how are you gonna do that I can understand that. I used to have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I could never do my home work without him. Boy, he does think better with that bat. I've gotta go out to Andrews. Yes you did! A jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine. What does that mean! You're the marine. Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home and talk to my daughter.

69,JESSEP,A Few Good Men,1992,True,"Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago. Yeah, well, apparently he's not very happy down here at ShangriLa, cause he's written letters to everyone but Santa Claus asking for a transfer. And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting. Matthew You're appalled This kid broke the Chain of Command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and it would appear that he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's going on over at Windward, Matthew And I'm yours, Matthew. I want to know what we're gonna do about this. He's that bad, huh Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose you're right. I suppose that's the thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a better idea. Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's  on second thought  Windward. The whole Windward division, let's transfer 'em off the base. Jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence, they're packing their bags. Tom! Got me the President on the phone, we're surrendering our position in Cuba. Wait a minute, Tom. Don't call the President just yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second. Maybe  and I'm just spit balling here  but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago. Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. Yes. I'm certain I once read that somewhere. And now I'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way. Santiago stays where he is. We're gonna train the lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I'm gonna blame you. Then I'm gonna kill you. Matthew, I believe I will have that word in private with you now. Jon, that's all. Why don't you and I have lunch at the O club, we'll talk about the training of young William. Dismissed. Matthew, sit, please. What do you think of Kendrick I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. But he's an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit. We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew. That's a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously. And I believe that taking a marine who's not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger. Matthew, siddown. We go back a while. We went to the Academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our tours in Vietnam together. But I've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have. Now if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you, well, I don't give a shit. We're in the business of saving lives, Captain Markinson. Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer. Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown. Pleased to meet you, Commander. I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick to join us. Lionel Kaffee Well what do you know. Son, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods. Jefferson vs. Madison County School District. The folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all white school, Lionel Kaffee said we'll just see about that. How the hell is your dad Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, asshole. Well, what can we do for you, Danny. Jonanthan'll take you out and show you what you wanna see, then we can all hook up for lunch, how does that sound ...And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to. STEWARDS That was delicious, men, thank you. Shoot. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base. On the first available flight to the states. Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out. Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead. I've heard the term, yes. I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Sovietmade Cuban MlAl6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo You know it just hit me. She outranks you, Danny. I want to tell you something Danny and listen up 'cause I mean this You're the luckiest man in the world. There is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning. Promote 'em all I say. You see my problem is, of course, that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have to keep taking cold showers 'til they elect some gal President. Take caution in your tone, Commander. I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous. What's that For the file. Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order. For the file. I'm here to help anyway I can. You believe that, don't you Danny That I'm here to help anyway I can The corporal'll run you by Ordinance on your way out to the airstrip. You can have all the transfer orders you want. But you have to ask me nicely. You have to ask me nicely. You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. I can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear. I don't want money and I don't want medals. What I want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform, and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin' courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely. No problem. I hate casualties, Matthew. There are casualties even in victory. A marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon, that marine's a hero. The foundation of the unit, the fabric of this base, the spirit of the Corps, they are things worth fighting for. Dawson and Downey, they don't know it, but they're smothering a grenade. Yes I do. Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Yes. Yes. I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched. I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately. I felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out. Is there another kind The six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base. Yes. As are you, Lieutenant. I wore fatigues on the plane. Yes. I brought a change of clothes and some personal items. I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him know I'd be in town. The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth. I thought she might like to have dinner tonight. No. It's not. It's tragic. Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago.  What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer Phone calls and footlockers Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill. Do you have any other questions for me, counselor Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. I beg your pardon. Colonel. I'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've earned it. I don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here. What would you like to discuss now! My favorite color Yes. This is ridiculous. Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake. That's right. Crystal. Ignored the order No. No. Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son Ever served in a forward area Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear Are we clear Private Santiago was a substandard marine. He was being transferred off the base because Yes. That's correct, but Yes, I recall what I know what I said. I don't need it read back to me like I'm a damn Sometimes men take matters into their own hands. You little bastard. You want answers You want answers! You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it You You, Lt. Weinberg I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to. I did the job you sent me to do. You're goddamn right I did. What the hell's going on Captain, what the hell's going on I did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm getting on a plane and going back to my base. What the hell I'm being charged with a crime I'm that's what this is Marine! Marine!! job. I'm being charged with a crime I'm that's what's happening This  I'm this is funny, you know that, this is I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine. I saved lives. That boy was  there was a weak link. I saved lives, you hear me You fuckin' people. You have no idea how to defend a nation. All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did. You put people in danger.

70,ROSS,A Few Good Men,1992,False,"Dan Kaffee. Welcome to the big time. I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball. They plead guilty to manslaughter, I'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll be home in half that time. Can't do it. I don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine. The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure. Oh man. Are we off the record I'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago. Hey, we got a little fouronfour going tomorrow night. When does your plane get in Hang on... I didn't Who is this What exactly are you accusing me of, commander Kendrick specifically told the men not to touch Santiago. That's not what Kendrick said. You have proof And I have 23 marines who aren't accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation. We'll never know. You can try, but you won't find him. You know what Markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps Counter Intelligence. Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson. Jessep's star is on the rise. Division'll give me a lot of room to spare Jessep and the corps any embarrassment. I'll knock it all down to assault. Two years. They're home in six months. No you're not. 'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it. And he knows that if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way, they'll be charged with the whole truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct Unbecoming, and even though he's got me by the balls out here, Dan knows that in a courtroom, he loses this case. Danny's an awfully talented lawyer, and he's not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months. That's the end of this negotiation. From this moment, we're on the record. I'll see tomorrow morning at the arraignment. Too late. No objection, your honor. Yes sir. The facts of the case are this At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoonmate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire. Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year What did the letter say Was that marine identified in the letter And what did you find And who was that Your witness. Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter. And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire No more questions. Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lt. Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of second platoon. Would you tell the Court the substance of that meeting Did that make you mad You can tell the truth, corporal, it's alright. Did it make you mad How mad Were the other members of the squad angry Were Dawson and Downey Corporal, did Lt. Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting What was it What was the order Your witness. The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas In light of the defense that Lt. Kaffee is planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony. The Government'll agree to the stipulation, sir. Dr. Stone, what's lactic acidosis How long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar And what caused Santiago's muscles and other cells to start burning sugar Commander Stone is an expert medical witness, in this courtroom his opinion isn't considered speculation. Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison Then how do you justify Thank you, sir. Object. Move to strike. Dr. Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned Thank you, sir, I have no more questions. Please the Court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises, the Government rests. Object. The witness is characterizing. Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book Have you read it Good. Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please. Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds. We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct No Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds No further questions. That was nice work today. The redirect on Howard. Where is he Damn. I have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to CourtMartial for professional misconduct. And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer. Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I'm your friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, I don't think your clients belong in jail. But I don't get to make that decision. I represent the Government of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a case. I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence. You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny. By everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway, shit, I practically dared you. Not for a second have you believed you could win. You got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer. Your boys are going down. I can't stop it anymore. Objection. Argumentative. Please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say. We object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness. Thank you judge. Object! please the court Lieutenant, don't answer that. Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red Lt. Kendrick, did you Thank you. Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks About how far by jeep Have you ever had to walk it And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 1620. But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 1645. If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 1645, then how could you be in your room at 1620 Private, did you ever actually hear Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red Why did you go into Santiago's room The witness has been read his rights, commander. Why did you go into Santiago's room Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it He did, didn't he Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red. Don't look at him. Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General CourtMartial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please. Objection. I'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information. Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular Your honor. Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future Judge Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies. Your honor Your Honor, these men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination. Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess to Object! Your Honor Judge Damnit Kaffee!! Guard the prisoner. Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent. Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by courtmartial or other judicial or administrative proceeding. You have the right... Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as I have just read then to you Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez What exactly were these guys gonna testify to Strong witnesses. I'll see you around the campus. I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.

72,GRACE,Taking Lives,2003,False,"It's okay, I'm supposed to be here. Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk to you guys yet. I need a little more time here. 9. Would you mind trading one liners somewhere else I need to hear the natural sounds. I appreciate it. 10. Don't shoot, I'm on your team. Call who you have to call.   I found his head. You only have one victim. Usually there's two or three by the time I get called in. You clear the Mayor What do you think This was not a heat of the moment killing. And the victim was buried complete with head. The grave was fivefoot ten. The victim's height. With square corners. Dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring. I've been called worse. No. A large canine did that. Probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug up the body and chewed off the head. It felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away from the other wolves. Bingo.   That's your murder weapon. No. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker. That's exactly what it is. A theory. That evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. Inspector. I can see that Director.   You're lucky to have them. Go ahead, Director, say what you have to say. Sure. A forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull. I know someone at Quantico who can do it by tomorrow. 14. Call 'em. Then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago. You have his initials MRC, inside the wetsuit. The long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him. It's a semilong shot. I had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains. No headhunters, sir.   However, a killer is out there. 15. He wasn't missed. He had no family, or moved often. He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman. He spent a lot of time in his kayak. Always is, sir. I can give you a rough profile white male, thirty to thirtyfour. Has some college but no degree. Neat in appearance. At least six feet tall. Very intelligent. Charming when necessary. He uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor. He's killed before and will again unless caught. A couple days, sir. 16. Shame.   Goodlooking guy. Vanderholt With a C Can you do a full records search Criminal, credit, commercial history. Transcripts. Everything. 17. You're an awesome investigator, Inspector. Run his name on every database you can. I'll see you in the morning. Fruit of the Gods. You know you want one. Mr. Kohler has been dead two years. No doubt about that. Right 18. So before he died he got his paychecks, paid his taxes. Patronized sporting goods stores. And had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors. That pattern continues a year after his death. He gets some paychecks. Rents an apartment. Buys a three thousand dollar kayak. Pays his taxes. Dead and buried and still paying his taxes. Then everything stops. Last Visa charge was to Travelocity for a plane ticket to Mexico city. This isn't someone renting limos and fancy dinners on someone else's credit. Lifestyle and habits don't change. Too many independent systems. You really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide Inspector, this guy's whole life has been stolen. Someone killed him and became him. Down to profession and taste in clothing. 19. You're everywhere. What's up, Laval He's still warm. 20. Want to get those Where is it Holy shit.   Has Le Directeur been notified Maybe. So far he checks out as an art dealer from Winnipeg. 21. You need to confirm he's a suspect or clear him and kickstart a manhunt based on Costa's ID. If he is a legit witness, he'll get heated up and start forgetting details. I think there's a way to clear him without pissing him off. May I Inspector.   I need a moment with you. I have a shortcut. Can you get any of his school transcripts Call the Winnipeg Police and have them fax or email his driver's license photo. Sorry. I'm the dumb one. Agent Vanderholt. Call me Grace. Hold on. Before you do that, I need some personal information from you. Can you write down the name of the elementary school you attended And your elementary school teachers, as many as you can remember. I apologize, I know it's random, but it's the best way you can help me. Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be surprised. May I That's what 25. Go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw. We'll get an artist to help you. I know. See if he tries to peek in it. The real killer couldn't resist. He'll want to know what we know. 26. Can you remember any of your grade school teachers He remembered three. Have a nurse take a DNA sample. Just to make sure his DNA isn't in the victim's car or anything weird. WVSS.   1995. What's that CWE Whose initials   Not the victim's. Doctor, can I take you back to Quantico with me Inspector Reynaud. Can we swing by the crime scene before we head back Inspector. C'mere a second, please. Borrow your keys Stand there like you're going to choke me. Keys drop straight down, how'd they end up over there under that car Okay. Kick them as hard as you can that way. Not even halfway. 29. I had this case. This young hundredpound woman was abducted from a parking lot. She kicked off a mirror, broke a window, dented her door. She struggled. This guy Nothing. Good question.  Do we trust Costa You guys have an extra weapon I didn't want to cross the border armed. I smell smoke. Back where I'm from anyone can kick a door if there's a fire. It's the 'citizen's arrest' of search warrants. Clear. Ugh.   Got a lung full. 31. Looks like this guy ran out in the middle of breakfast. Resembles the man Costa sketched. Have you released him You don't want your star witness steaming in a holding cell. 32. I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like Messieurs Kohler and Ford. Which looks like all the victims. Maybe he's subconsciously killing himself. Ever see a Hermit crab It's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails. When they outgrow an old shell, they search for a new empty shell, crawl up to it and quickly switch. 33. They live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies. They couldn't survive without the shells. Neither can the guy we're after. With that much detail, you could become anyone. More like a kind of camouflage. They're working really hard. Someone died last night because the asshole we're after isn't in custody. It's happened to me before and I'm sure it will happen again. It's a pretty miserable feeling. Thank you. I promised the boys I'd hang out tonight. I'm sorry. It's okay. I was a street cop in Philadelphia for three years before I joined the FBI. Life is pretty cold sometimes. Man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered. Only the new improved Mr. Ford was going to meet he ship. I doubt it. He's been so meticulous and effective in the past, I bet he's never needed one. We can assume he has all sorts of fake IDs and passports. Disguises. But that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else. He gets off impersonating people. And he knows his current persona is compromised. What Pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss. I'm dropping by Costa's, I still have a couple questions. I can't turn it off. 37. Mr. Costa. Not yet. Overpriced folk art. Is it the work of a soul that has suffered Sure. Are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking No. I couldn't afford it. Excuse me. I'm partial to beer. And I don't have long. I came by to thank you for your help. And I apologize if you were detained. You did the right thing. Trying to save him. Who knows.   Where'd you learn CPR Some journey. About Monday again, did you see Mr. Ford fighting back No, I don't. I guess that's it. Thanks. If you remember any details or need anything. Anything related to the case, please call me. Morning. Can you run this name She got twenty hangup calls from Edward's phone. What happened to that beautiful thumbprint on the orange juice glass, you get an ID Shit. Any activity on Edward's accounts 40. Why a year ago. You connected Edwards and Kohler Somebody was working all night. Our suspect kills Kohler on the river, lives his life a year, kills Edwards and assumes his ID for a year. Then he stalks Ford, kills him but is interrupted by Costa. Think he's pissed at Costa She must have sounded like a total fruitcake. Let me go and be nonthreatening. Do you think it's Martin calling and hanging up Were you ever asked to identify his body 42. No.   I'm with the FBI. You have some very nice things, Mrs. Asher. Is that Martin I'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he drown Their fourteenth birthday You said Reese was older. To lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later to think you've lost him. That must have been devastating. The police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in Martin's grave and verify identity. 44. I know.     I was snooping. I know. That doesn't surprise you That lady is definitely a queen without a country. I should have curtsied. Hygiene on the road. Very efficient. She signed.   Start digging. How soon, sir Vanderholt. Yes.   What Find the real Martin Asher. He's your killer. You better get his mother someplace safe. How'd she finagle a room there She didn't have one picture of Martin. Not one. Even cut him out of the old yearbooks. And she had a basement door like a vault. She's hiding something. In the basement of her house. What is it, ten minutes away from here Her house. You're right. We should make sure her front door is locked. Yeah, I'll get 'em. Let's be friends. 49. 50. I think I just shaved ten years off my life. Yes. Rabies scares me.     Only rabies. Nothing else. Vanderholt. At the art gallery Are they still there Did you call the police We'll be right there. I'm sending a car. Don't touch anything. How long were you gone Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't know if there's a connection yet. How do we know Costa didn't stage this For attention or something. We should take the computer. Should I believe you Or should I believe this. Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot Thank you.   I just needed you to say it. John, no harm will come to you. Listen to me. No harm will come to you. I promise. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters. 54. We want you to be there tonight. He won't get within fifty feet of you. The second we see him, the cuffs go on. Costa fits Asher's choice of victims. Travels the World looking for art. Single. No kids or anything. Asher's here somewhere. Watching. With all the patience in the world. 56. You got kids Don't keep them in a cage. 57. I know you have a life. So did the people who have lost theirs. Someone else might die if you do not help us. Every time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives. If somebody else dies, and you know you could have done more to stop it, you're going to feel like shit for a very long time, Mr. Costa. 58. It's okay to be scared. You saw him and that's enough. Don't stop living your life. You'll be protected by armed officers twentyfour seven. I can't promise you that. A car is watching the gallery. You'll be okay. I'm sure Soulsby's death was a homicide, Asher saw the opportunity and took it. He became Soulsby and bummed around Seattle for a couple years. Costa saw him. Costa caught him in the act, caught him being Martin Asher. Seen first by his mother, then by Costa. For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards. To be seen, to be recognized, is a horrifying thing to Asher. He has no identity and wants it that way. Likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere. South of the American border somewhere. Visa records put Asher, using Kohler's ID and Edwards at a Mexican surf resort. Edwards' last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a 'no questions asked' facelift clinic in Guadalajara. He's focused on Costa. Who fits the profile of Asher's victims. He went on Costa's computer and E mailed copies of Costa's files to an Email account in Denmark. Constant threat of discovery, Asher will become more disorganized. It does sound crazy. That's what the press likes, sir. Security is going to be very solid tonight. He won't show. But we want to be here in case he does. Four plainclothes officers will form a perimeter watching the four corners. Yes. And four plainclothes officers will be in here. Mingling. The officers will be very discreet. We won't interfere with your thing. Sure.     If you feel safer. Thanks. This isn't me. 63. I'm trying to get into the show, but I mean. What is this It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden. Oh. Okay. Why the borders Almost every painting has one. Was he in prison or something What was his crime Always is. He had a lot of lovers, didn't he Now he's dead and you get rich I don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you. An FBI agent Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss an arrangement for the series. She's not writing the checks. 65. Don't you miss wax What's my cut I don't know. Shit.     You see him 69. 70. 71. Need a ride home That might be a good idea. Until then I'll check under your bed for monsters. Please, don't. John, stop it. Please. Let's shift the conversation from me and my business onto something inbounds. No excuses.   I'm sorry. We got his name. We catch everyone sooner or later. I'm done profiling you.   I got you figured out. Is that how you see yourself This is how you see me And how do you see me I don't know. John, games are fun. But head games are dangerous. The Justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until Mr. Asher is in custody. I apologize if you've been getting the wrong signal. Another province. They want you on a flight tomorrow morning. Thank you, Sergeant. What you need.   Movers can get the rest. I'll let them know. No monsters. I probably won't see you again until the trial. If there is a trial. You staying or going Is everyone okay They're okay. Let's go. He just shot a cop. Let's go.   Bad guy's that way. Which way's the river   Go to the river. Turn around. Let's go! Nothing broken Don't move, okay. This hurt You're going to the hospital. You'll be fine. Very dead. You're really good with people. He got off light. With a broken wrist and fifty stitches. Lucky man. I'm sorry, Director. Hey. You okay Anytime. Do you know where he was taking you It's over. Let me take you out tonight. Let's have some fun. I owe you that. It's going to   take a couple days to depose you   and get a full statement. I    thought you might enjoy a break   before you have to... You'll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it. I can stop monsters, John.     And because I can, I have to. Neither.   It's just my job. Roy Wilson. You're a sharp one, John Costa. That's right. You were the cheese in the trap. We stopped a monster. That's what matters. I'm sorry.   I'm a pig. Want a beer What's that mean People like me 89. You are a trip, John Costa. Okay. I guess I'm running and chasing. Growing up I quit speaking after that. I didn't say a word for three years. When you're not in the conversation, you get forgotten real quick. So I'd watch people. Study them. The mouth can say anything, but the body doesn't lie. The tilt of the head, the way the hands move. The day my Uncle died. The truth exploded out of me like a vision. My Uncle and Father had been arguing, there was a gunshot and my father was dead. I remember my Uncle telling me not to say anything. And I didn't. 90. I made myself forget why. The day he died my voice and my memory came back. I screamed for an hour. Very primal. I haven't shut up since. Land. Greatgrandpa owned half of Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted control and sold it all. All that's left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture. My father's murderer got away with it because I couldn't open my mouth. Something good game out of it. The dead can't speak. Now I'm their voice. Martin Asher is dead, right That's the point. He's dead, so there won't be a trial where you or I would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate. 91. Jesus. How mean.   Serves you right. John.    John. I thought you were scared of blood That was my boss. I'm going back to Quantico tomorrow. 94. Staple his mouth too, Doc. Vanderholt. Not her son   You're sure That's weird. Was he adopted, switched at birth So John Costa is really Martin Asher Are you Martin Holy shit. Who 96. Good idea.   Don't hurt me. Shit! Police emergency. We need to pursue him. He's a murder suspect. Director Gillet, there's an emergency, can you please tell this officer to cooperate with me 97. No answer.     She turns her phone off. Shut up and focus. That kind of shit helps no one right now. Get right, I got left. Don't move! Omigod. That's none of your business. Back off, Reynaud. Asher fooled you too. Touch me again and I will kick your ass. I know. Director, I'm the last person you should be discussing the case with at this point. Not here. This city no longer has the psychic gravity to hold him here. Try Mexico, getting a facelift. Richard Hart. Let me guess, Costa was selling stolen art for Hart and never gave him the money. Now Hart is just another one of Asher's victims. Go to hell. I won't pay you a dime. I'm not scared of you. Come and get me. I will never pay you, dumbass. Asher taunted Hart into a confrontation. Jesus. It was right there in my face. I was interpreting behavior from two different suspects. Anything he wants. Ah, the undertakers have arrived for my career. 103. Yessir. He needed a murder he could link not only Richard Hart to but also to his past victims. Hart's behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who won't pay. He had no idea he was being manipulated by a serial killer. 104. Asher wasn't becoming disorganized and decomposing into madness, he was evolving. The Ford murder was staged and I missed it. Asher drove Ford's car there with Ford unconscious in the car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something that disappears. Asher works out, heads to the parking lot. Pulls Ford out of the trunk. And strangles him. He left a couple of Hart's hairs on the body. He draws a nice portrait of Mr. Hart and he's now inside the heart of Montreal PD's investigation. 105. Evidence at the Ford crime scene led to an apartment with more of Hart's DNA. And evidence linking Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart never set food in that apartment. Asher staged everything. Yes. Hart thought Costa was systematically destroying his life. Hart's violent explosion was inevitable. He couldn't. My guess is Asher intended to kill Hart and make it look like suicide. The authorities would find the body and close the Martin Asher file. No.   I have nothing to say. 106. You'll manage. It wasn't I'll dig a hole and hide in it. Hello I'm here. Why don't you come and see me. I miss you, too. I'm at the Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6 off Highway 29. Stop by. 108. Six months. Twins. You're so full of shit your eyes turned brown. How the fuck did you find me Get it over with. Just get it over with. What happens if I don't want to assume this woman's identity and raise my babies with a serial killer Answer my question. You'll do what you have to do. I can respect that. How do you know it's still real Maybe it's gone. What we felt. God, I missed you so much. Better you than me, asshole.

73,DIRECTOR GILLET,Taking Lives,2003,False,"I can't tell you how excited we are to have you here. This case made page one of the Globe. The tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose. 11. The Mayor wants closure. That's his vacation house they were building. I get calls from supervisors I didn't know I had. We cleared the Mayor. He read the article on you in Newsweek and insisted we fly you up. The papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head. I don't solve crimes anymore, I balance budgets. Thirtyfive detectives searched the area Saturday. My investigators think you're a witch. Jeez. Look at that, looks like he got icepicked. 12. Laval and Reynaud are my stars. Very smart, very persistent investigators. On the street they're magnificent. You're the expert. If you have any suggestions on how to proceed... We have people. No, that's bread and butter detective work. Thank you. We should get upstairs. No name yet, sir. We have someone from the University recreating his face from the skull. Is that our killer Please. 23. We could have had him this morning. So he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy. What's his real name 34. Find it, Laval. Find him. I know. I haven't felt it in a long time. Dinner So who was in Asher's grave Why is Asher after Costa Why isn't he in Mexico getting a new face Where is the real Mr. Edwards Have you contacted the clinic Keep's the collection agencies off the trail. How do we flush Mr. Asher Okay. My office will arrange a press conference. I will tell a room full of correspondents we have a suspect who is dead and murder victims who are alive. And I'll sound like a madman. Mr. Asher, we know who you really are. We will find you and we will arrest you. You can hide no longer. 61. Please, Jean. I called your wife. I'm having someone take you home to her. There is nothing left to do here. I'm ordering you home. How's Mr. Costa My luck has run out. Until today I have never had to bury a friend. Thankfully it's over. We have our man. Asher's DNA matched the hairs recovered on Ford's body and in the apartment. 86. They're on their way from the airport. Your old life is over. There is no going back. 101. You're still young. Whatever happens, be strong. Where is he, Grace How do we find him Grace.    You know his mind, and his heart.    Where is he We ID'd the remains in the morgue. The real ID. He was an addict. And a thief. An art thief. He hits galleries in Europe and North America. Traveled back and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses. 102. Costa owed him eight thousand. Those are Emails off Hart's computer. He had us all fooled, Grace. All of us.

74,COSTA,Taking Lives,2003,False,"I walk out of the gym. Walk to my car. I'm unlocking it and I hear a scuffle, a fight. Over by this car I see this guy getting choked from behind and I shouted. 'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then the person doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran. I'm so stupid. I could of been shot. I called the police gave him CPR until the paramedics came. Of course.   I was giving him CPR. The thing around his neck Yes. I took it off, it was choking him. Away from me. The kind that puts really big holes in people. Black. Listen to me. I can draw a picture of his face. I saw him. A sketch. I can sketch him.     I'm very good. I did not do this. I saw two guys fighting and should of ran the other way but I didn't. You need to find the person who killed this man. You need to find the guy who did this. I hope you guys are playing bad cop smart cop. Thank you. He had these real intense eyes. 24. Are you kidding me Lady, I saw someone get killed tonight and you're asking me about grade school I don't remember any of that. I attended two. Holy Trinity and Mother of Good Counsel. I remember Sister Bernard. And. I don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr. Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien, she had a glass eye. Omigod.   That's it, isn't it The thing around his neck. I told the other guy, I'll tell you. I did not do this. Grace. I saw who did this and I can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him. I can draw him, thank you. You caught me. Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him in Haiti last year. Very troubled life. Outlived all his children. And he had ten. He lost his wife to cancer and went blind. Passed away last year. Ouch. And I was going to send you two and charge them to your Amex. What about Daddy's Amex I've sold quite a bit of art to poor little rich girls like you. 38. Try the wine. Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt. I'm having a show Friday. You should come by and meet some good people. Medical school. Before I dropped out. I had a moment of clarity in anatomy class I realized I'd rather draw bodies than cut them up. And when I realized I couldn't make art, I decided to sell it. It's taken me all over the world. At first I thought I was interrupting something, you know I thought they were hugging. Then the gun came out when he saw me. 39. Okay. Think about Friday. Please, Grace Grace. Someone broke into my office. Minutes ago. Yes.   My office here. No. You told me to call you if anything happened. 51. I do all my calls to Europe and shipping stuff at night. My address book was on the screen when I went out for coffee. I came back and this was on the screen. Ten minutes. Maybe. When I returned, that was on the screen. Is this about the strangling   Is that guy after me No.  Everything's here. Shit. He took my organizer and my business checkbook. 52. Don't take the computer.    That's my brain. I'm not making this up.     Believe me. Believe what you want. 53. CUT WIDE TO I must of walked right past him. Yes. That's him. That is the man I saw murder Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym. No doubt. Now will you go catch him, please Who is this guy He's like a Ninja. Sneaking into my office. How dangerous is he Does he want to kill me How many people have you killed No. I'm not meeting him. Absolutely not. You ever go fishing The bait always dies. Grace, no. What if he shoots me in the head You're good. You could move a lot of art if you wanted to. And inspire some too, I'm sure. 55. Could you look any more like a cop Could I have some water    I'm cooking in this thing. What I have a life. I can't play superhero for you. I don't handle stress very well. I have an art show to open tomorrow and I don't know what I'm putting on the walls yet. Grace, I've been cooperating. I even drew you a picture. You can't put your responsibility on me. You have a badge, not me. I want to help you guys but I don't have time to hang out and listen to bad techno. Scared I'm offthecharts terrified. There's a pissedoff serial killer after me. I mean, what did I do to him Until he's caught I have a lot of work to do. They're protecting the art. Go ahead and hang those. Be very careful. Is he going to show up tonight What do I do, offer him a drink A perimeter, excellent. Mingling I don't need four bruisers crashing through my clientele. 62. With my thing.    Will you be mingling Much safer. You look a little anxious. It's all you. Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a branch. Most people don't notice. This is from his prison series. He could see a mango grove through his cell window. He made some of the pigments himself. From flowers. From his own blood. He attacked his neighbor with a machete. There was a woman involved. Dozens. He was a consumer of life's pleasures. 64. His children formed a corporation, I take ten percent. I'm not a buccaneer, Grace. What You're very sensitive for...

I don't wanna get hurt. Yessir. I apologize for everything you think I may have done. Stop it! 67. I'm okay. The night started out great. Everything gelled. Everyone was happy. You helped land a big fish and the feeding frenzy started. Six figure pieces were flying off the wall. He said he was going to blow out my spine. I was thinking surgery. Six months in bed. Exercise pools. Never walking again. 72. He was in my bathroom and none of you could stop him. I need to leave town. I would appreciate that very much. Can I profile you I read your book.

You drive. 87. I'm happy to be alive but it's like this door has been opened.      I don't think I was naive. But everything is different now. How do you deal with it All the misery and pain and violence. So is it a calling or a curse When I was in med school I saw a guy on a Harley get Tboned by a Daihatsu. He was screaming in pain and needed help and I knew what to do, I had all my certs, but I saw all this blood and froze. I failed the big test. Byebye, med school. Hello, graphic design. The man on the Harley. So you knew about that. No wonder you knew what to say to keep me cooperating. 88. You threw me in a tiger cage like a piece of meat. I don't trust anyone who's too organized. Please. Which is it, are you a runner or chaser People like you Yeah, people like you. Hardcore. Gungho people like you. And you know what I mean. People like you are either runners or chasers. I'm sorry.   I didn't know. How'd you get your voice back You are very intense, you know that Why did your Uncle do it That's a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eightyearold girl. Can we please forget about him We haven't done anything. In college we tried to make my friend's German Shepherd take a bong hit. Let them watch. 92. Mmmmm.   Morning. My stitches must have ripped.

75,MRS. ASHER,Taking Lives,2003,False,"Hi, please come in. Thank you for coming. I'm glad they finally sent someone, those hangup calls have me terrified. They started right after I saw him. I looked him directly in the eye. There was a moment of mutual recognition. It couldn't sound crazier, but who else The body Yes, they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck. The upper body was crushed. There was no face. I got physically ill. You're not Canadian, are you There was three. About two weeks ago. I began turning off my telephone when I go to bed. Thank you. Some of them have been in my family for several generations. Please call me Rebecca. No. That's Reese. Martin's older brother. He drowned in a terrible accident. The San Michel River. Martin fell out of their raft and Reese jumped in to save him. 43. There was a lot of snowmelt that year. Martin reached the bank. Reese didn't. It was their fourteenth birthday. They were twins. Identical twins. By three minutes. They were very different boys. Reese was very charismatic and outgoing. Martin was introverted. He never thrived like Reese. He was a very disturbed young man. Reese was Martin's world. Martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him. He changed. Martin began to intimidate me. He could be very menacing. He began imitating Reese at school and that lead to fights with other students. At sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away. A few days later the Thunder Bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire. I'll sign it. I already know somebody else's son is in that casket. Excuse me. 45. The bathroom is there. My friends call it the shrine.     It can be difficult to let go. He's killing people, isn't he No.   It doesn't. Nineteen years ago I stood in this same room and your predecessor showed me a washtub full of blood and guts and told me it was my son. I will touch anything I want, Doctor. I'm not going through this a third time. It's not him. That's not my blood. You people are incredible. Good idea, Doctor. He's smarter than all of you, do you know that Don't show me that, Martin. I had Rex put down after you ran away. Martin, sit. How dare you defy me. You will sit down on that couch and you will do it now. Martin. Martin, you have severe emotional problems. I know you're in a lot of pain. There's hope and help, Martin. Look at me, Martin.

77,MINI,Mini's First Time,2006,True,"Well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school...I promise. A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started. 2. I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday... See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me. A few days before the party, I overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says I love you like ten inches of man meat in your face. And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed. 3. That guy Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out. Yo, beeach! Is it on That's my girl! See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. Firsts is what I call them. 4. Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my first...rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many firsts into it as possible. SURPRISE! MINI'S POV That was definitely a first, but more importantly, it was the first time I really understood my potential...And that's when it all started. Reed Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday ever! 5. That little stunt got me grounded for a week, but it was worth it. See, I just don't understand people who live their lives as one big routine. They're basically saying I'm not worthy of a unique experience on this earth....Well, sorry, but I am. The law of firsts has served me well, because it's liberated me from the usual pathetic, repetitive concerns of high school. I simply don't care if I'm popular, because if I did, then I'd be constantly stressing about whether my clothes are cool enough, or if Troy, the gay but he doesn't know it yet quarterback, is gonna call. 6. Just keep walking and don't look at him. ROY, a cocky, chiseled, allaround nightmare, sticks his Ahh...The joys of the American educational system. Actually, Troy, I think you confused her with that senile, toothless grandmother of yours. Actually, now that you mention it, I can't think of anything I'd rather do than suck your dick. 7. Really I'm going to suck your dick, Troy, you said I could. No, Troy, I want to suck your dick right now! No, Troy! You said I could, now come on! 8. Let's see it! Come on, I want to suck your throbbing member right now! WHAT! Sorry. Sorry! Thanks, mommy. What do you want Fine. Gosh, you're right, mom, I'm such a cow. It's a freakin' miracle I'm not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks. Have fun, don't do anything I wouldn't. Cunt. 10. her mouth. My mother moved out to LA from Ohio when she was twenty to become an actress. Even though she was a total flatliner, somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps...without screwing anyone. When she gets really sauced, she'll pop the tapes in and make me watch, then I'll threaten to call the suicide hotline. After a few years, she got desperate and spread 'em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn. She got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn't be on the show, unless she hoovered me out. Excuse me for one sec. You're late. 11. She was gonna do it, too, at least that what's she told me when she was feeling particularly loving. But then she heard rumors the show wasn't gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child support beat thirteen weeks on Skin Tight, so I got to stick around. ...Bad choice. NT. THE WET BAR  LATER. Anyway, what Mom didn't count on was the prick having a heart attack and croaking a year after I was born. When she tried to collect on his estate, she found out he'd owed the government two point five in back taxes. 12. Now, if she had been smart, she would've set her sights a little lower and gone after a guy who would've worshipped the ground she walked on and wouldn't care that she already had a kid... But not mom, she was gonna bag another elephant if it meant gobbling every knob from Hollywood to the Palisades. Oh, I will...Like some coffee for the road So it pretty much went on like that until... Five years ago, when she met Martin. It was a winwin... He didn't want kids, but needed a readymade family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings...We finally got out of Reseda... It was great for about a year... Then he figured out what he had married...by then it was too late. 15. You're home early. First time in three months he's walked in before Letterman. He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now I'm thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or...found a new pin. Bingo. Tough day Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists He's a partner at a public relations firm, which is ironic because I can't remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together...or had relations. 16. No, she went to a party off Beachwood. She was in one of her happy moods, so I doubt she'll be sleeping here... If you were thinking of inviting a guest over. Yeah Haven't even cracked a book. Considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed, you've got to admire his resolve. He could've left her years ago, but with no pre nup, he loses half and he just won't give in. 17. Their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm. As I said, the rule of firsts guides my life. Once you've gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for. I thought it would be a goof if I put a photo ad in one of those 25 cent outcall massage newspapers they sell around town. But I just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail. So I went to an escort service, and when they found out I was 18, they told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night...if I was up to it. Would you look at them 18. It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to be, what At least twenty eight...In dog years. Oh, wait, that would make her four. My first night as a call girl was a serious let down. It turns out both guys were in town for the Promise Keepers convention. The first one got so excited I didn't even get a chance to get my panties off before he creamed himself. And the other said I looked so much like his niece, he started whimpering and praying for forgiveness. 19. Time to bat the eye lashes... This Are you kidding My first woman and my first cop...It would've been perfect if she hadn't wanted to cuddle afterwards. Yeah, I turned two tricks and went down on a dyke cop. 20. God, what's gotten into her She was almost warm and fuzzy. After that night, things really picked up. My one rule which the agency wasn't too happy about was, of course, only firsts, no repeat customers. But believe me, they didn't have too much trouble honoring that request. 21. I'd make house calls to offices at lunch hour and we'd say I was someone's niece or cousin in town on vacation. XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS  NIGHT And then when football season started, Saturday through Monday... I was busier than Domino's. Then one Thursday night I get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so wifey doesn't find the motel bills on the gold card statements. They say I'm just his type...young. They tell me he's not big on the chitchat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for. 22. Can you fucking believe it Uh...hi, southern accent Sorry, I'm Mlate. Mind if I freshen up My own dad! My first thought was how sick is he But then I started thinking...I'm one to talk, and...well... 23. Why not I mean, he isn't my real dad...and talk about a first. The more I thought about it... ...the more turned on I got. Then I thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed, I could do her strange guy in this bed. accent Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would you mind turning the lights off, I'm kinda new to all this and a little shy. Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's tail. Oh, so you want complete access You do know that's extra Just so we're clear...Now, close your eyes. Come on. Now just keep them shut for a while. FADE OUT I can't believe I pulled that off. Keeping my face hidden actually wasn't that hard, and he pretty much let me do whatever I wanted. 25. And you know what...He was damn good. I don't why Mom is throwing the cat all over town, when she can have this every night. Thanks, Sugar. Ginger. I literally couldn't feel the ground under my feet. A first to top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him one day, but I wanted to savor it for a while. 26. Here's to immediate gratification. You were great. Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take. God, what a drama queen. Don't let this little act fool you. He'd never let mom get all his money. 27. This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate suicide! artin backs away from the railing. Now that's thinking outside the box. We spent the next few hours just sitting there. I don't think we said three words. I think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the sweetest nights I ever spent with a guy. He told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again. I told him that was fine. Suddenly, he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework. Kiddo Actually, I'm thinking about starting a 401K plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund NT. MINI'S BEDROOM  NIGHT It took exactly one week. In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school. 29. At first, we were very discreet, only doing it when Joan Crawford wasn't home or was completely comatose. Then we got bolder, doing it before she would pass out. I think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope. One night we did it before Entertainment Tonight ended. We even almost got caught. Yeah 30. God, I've told you a thousand times to knock. Uh...can't say that I have. Oh...sure, no problem. Okay, she's gone. Looking back, that may have been the moment we fell in love. 31. We became inseparable. Mom thought it was cute how we had suddenly grown so close, and thought it was wonderful how Martin had taken an interest in my education. Now that we were spending time together, I actually started to find out what Martin was like for the first time. He wasn't the drip I thought he was. 32. He was funny, charming, sweet and even a little shy. Being seen in public was no sweat, as long as we didn't act like a couple. This went on for two months, before we had the talk we both knew was coming. So. Well, I don't think telling her is such a hot idea. 33. You can't leave, she'll get half. Can I ask how the hell you married her without a prenup Her Well, there is another option. But it will take some planning... and some resolve. Kill her No, of course not, she is my mother. But I've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill Unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs. The only truly caring action we could take. You did it for the well being of your daughter. The selfless act of a devoted parent. And corroborated by friends and people outside the family. No, that would be useful. With lots of fresh air. Much. I awoke the next morning, as excited as I could remember. Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this would take determination... Stamina... 36. And imagination. I decided to start simply. Part one, violent mood swings slashuncontrollable rages. Anton Michelle, masseuse to the stars and reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town. Rumor has it, he's pouring the pork to every rich wife between Malibu and Pasadena. He must be incredible if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this early. Well, uh, you were kinda out of it last night. Now don't you listen to her, you are not a dickless wonder. Now, here comes the really fun part. I realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit I could do a passable job imitating... Hello, Anton It's Diane Tannen, I know it's late notice, but I'm going to have to cancel our appointment. What No, of course, I realize I'll still have to pay...yes, something came up. Needless to say, word of the L'incident de Anton spread quickly through the community. Do you think she'll press charges Jeez, I still can't believe you broke your hand on her face It's so Linda Hamilton. Phase two wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state. Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers. I know, can you believe all this Well, it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine. You mumbled something about a party before you took a nap. Mom, you did. The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol. I am so sorry. Listen, we'll pay, don't worry. Right on cue. Let's see how convincing he is. 43. Oooh, now I see why he makes the big bucks. Mom, go inside, just go, I'll handle him. It's under control, Dad. Please, let's not make a scene. MONTAGE Over the next few days, whenever Mom had passed out from too much drinkydrinky... I'd pull out her wallet... ...and reach out and touch someone. 44. It's really remarkable what you can order with a Platinum card these days. Talk about easy. After a week of my version of the home shopping network, the doorbell might as well have been a canon. At this point, dear old mummy was so spooked, I was actually afraid she might stop drinking. So I needed a back up plan, to keep her...offbalance. Now, here's someone I'd like to make sit, roll over and then toss me his snausage. But today... priorities are priorities. Mr. Bishop, can I go to the little girls room 45. The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush named Helga Hauptfuhrer, or der Fuhrer as she was affectionately known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip... NT. THE STALL  CONTINUOUS ...exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day. Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store. 46. Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and the lazy parents willing to let Der Fuhrer keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed. My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more. Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pickmeup. You're welcome. 47. The first time in my life she calls me sweetie and I've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys. Oh, this and that. Phase three rambling incoherent monologues in public. MacLean Stevenson. MacLean Stevenson played Larry. I'm sorry, but it was a golden opportunity. You always said you can't pay enough for good publicity. 50. At this point, with all those witnesses, Martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away. hey stop in front of a wall of tools hand axes, hammers and My feeling was that until they were ready to weld the door to her padded cell shut... ...there was more work to be done. Final phase Complete psychotic breakdown. Hey, boys. Wanna have a little fun 51. After her performance at the mall, I'm sure she would have qualified as committable. But that wasn't enough, I wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away. 55. For the last three days she hasn't left the house. Mom, we can't stay in here forever. Do you want to come with us Mom Ah...vanity, the most predictable of sins. Okay. 56. Our work finished... We rewarded ourselves on a job well done... 59. And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old. Mom, we're home! Mom Wake up, Mommy. Killjoy. Martin... e looks up and immediately sees the bottle. I picked that prescription up three days ago. It was probably more than half full. I suppose we should call an ambulance Do you really think they can save her She'll only try it again. You know she will. Hold on, who are we to say her choice was wrong She put those pills in her mouth. Don't Mini me, you've been bankrolling my little project from day one. I'd hardly call it murder, if anything, we're just helping to fulfill her last wish. So do people in comas. It's just a matter of time Look, you can drop the indignant outrage, because if you really cared, you'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now. Can't we just admit how lucky we are It's the perfect alibi, she put the drugs in her system. Exactly. Can you think of one person she knows who would say she's sane at this point This is just the natural, sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life. artin ponders the choice. We're this close from being free...let's just let nature take its course. And so we passed the time watching my favorite show. CLOSE ON THE TV Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my birthday, produces it and it's so twisted, I'm surprised I didn't think of it. Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiances. And we waited some more. NT. THE BATHROOM  LATER. Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last act of free will... Finally, it was time to do the only humane thing. 64. Come on, let's go. It's time to speed this up. We can't wait anymore, our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour. We can say that after dinner we went to a movie, but if she hasn't croaked by midnight, you can forget about this. Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in I hate to break it to you, but wherever you weren't prepared to go...the hypocrite express just rolled into the station. Well, I thought we'd disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons. Kidding...God, you've lost your sense of humor. Don't worry, it'll be painless. 65. To be honest, I think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this. And as my first assisted suicide, I was going to make it flawless. M Look, if we're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven. The gas chamber Martin, please, I can't explain everything. Have you lost your mind, Mr. Public Relations What's the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out How did she look Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is fabulous 66. Well, if you've got anything to say to her, now would be the time. Help us, please! My mom, I think she's dead! Mommy, wake up! 67. Oh, please, don't let her die! My mother just killed herself! They haven't even taken her away yet! What's wrong with you Tell him to leave! This is outrageous! Didn't you hear him! He said Who cares if we didn't leave a note Just relax. So what He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead. What I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans. Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we're free. 72. After the funeral, I felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time. artin tips the BELL HOP on the way out and the moment the Martin agreed and let me pick the place. I chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that's where Dudley Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten. I figured sugar daddyyounger woman would be old news down there. I could feel that Martin had let the whole thing with the cops go. It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago. You know, I've been thinking that I might enjoy working in your office this summer. 73. I want. I swear I thought Martin was going to wet himself. I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met You look so familiar. And the icing is that Jennifer works for the same escort service that I did. Now this is rich. Our loss He just lost six or seven freebies a year. Yikes, now that Mom's out of the way, I guess I'm fair game. I was just being friendly, I had no idea he'd decide to come here. I doubt he even knows where his trash cans are. 75. You're overreacting. It's just coincidence. It was dark, I sat up before he saw anything. M Just relax, what is he going to do Go home and tell everyone we're a couple We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers. Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration. Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen. 76. The next few days were a laugh riot. Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father. channels. Mini looks very annoyed. We returned home and things didn't get much better. MONTAGE What little sex we were having    was getting dull. Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed... 77. I was bored. I became concerned that in my world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first... ...at too young an age. Happy birthday, Mr. President As for school, well, I was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death. Uh oh. Yes Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And yes, I remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm. Nice work, McGruff. What do you want I know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but I didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation I could feel something tingle deep inside. A girl can dream, can't she Is it that important 79. Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her She clearly put some thought into that outfit. I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them. Really Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing I've done in a while, but even I know when the rush isn't worth the risk. Look, I think you should come back when my father's around. He'll be upset I let a stranger in the house.    G Even so, he won't be happy. I played it cool, it would've looked worse to be defensive. Tonight Hey, I didn't know you had plans! 81. Okay. That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad I mean, let's just get this over with. 82. Start time 9 o'clock. Running time 115 minutes. For god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it Dad...Don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet. Drive time 17 minutes. Precisely... With 12 minutes of previews. You didn't think we'd forget the previews It's probably just routine stuff. Nice use of the word us, by the way. If I had a nickel for every time I heard that Look, just chill, I'm sure this will blow over in a few days. He's probably just trying to spook us. It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't. I'll see you later. Out. 87. Would he follow Was there any question Worried that refugee from a J.Lo video rode me til the tires fell off 88. Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're aware, but at this point you can't be my dad and my lover. Where I go and how late I stay out is my business. Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her and I can assure you I won't end up passed out in some greaseball's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles... u nless I choose to. I kind of have to admire this. He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists. Congratulations... you're my first. 89. And I'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, Free Tibet. Fake tears aside...he actually was my first relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms. And I was willing to give him the chance to be that person... ...if he could just hold it together. That's when things started to get interesting. What are you gonna do Are you crazy We're not even positive it's him! He could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him, then they'd really start investigating us. It's just one photo and you can't even really tell if it's me. Well, if you start waving that thing around, he's gonna cost you a lot more than that. Martin didn't sleep at all that night and made damn well sure I didn't either. With Mommy Dearest out of the way, I decided to take the matter of Rudell into my own hands. I knew Martin wouldn't approve, but at this point...action had to be taken. 94. I would catch him off guard, disorient him and then kill him... ...with kindness. Hi, Mr. Rudell, I'm sorry to bother you. May I come in I know she'd approve. It's been hard, but I guess I've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now. Positive! Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together. A contestant Really It sounds like fun. Well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together. 96. It indicated that we were...I know this sounds crazy, but...a couple. Exactly, so we're just trying to figure who Rit could be. Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. I mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step father. Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage... 97. I knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time. And the one undeniable fact I had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life... ...than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to. Frankly, I'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a motherdaughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there. XT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE  LATER. Who can take tomorrow Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can 98. I left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon, I had turned Rudell into a trout on a line...and he'd follow me anywhere I tugged the pole. The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good... The photos stopped coming and although Martin was freaking out about his business, things were returning to normal. I even decided to return to school. Then things got interesting again. 99. Detective Garson, is everything all right black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's Can we see the tape of the Der Fuhrer sucking down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have cameras in the bathroom stalls 100. You got me, okay   But what was I supposed to do She...She said if I didn't, she was...was gonna My mother! She made me steal them for her! I didn't want to, but she said she was going to send me to boarding school in Canada if I didn't!   P The Yukon territories! Are you happy, now You got me! An addict Detective Garson knew! We told him, and now what The whole school's gonna know! She's dead, my mommy's dead. Can't we just leave her be 101. You gonna cuff me, Copper! It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick. Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow... ...my tongue. So you want me to say it was his idea At that moment I knew we had him. If he was trying to get me to rat on Martin, he didn't have enough to charge either one of us. 105. So if I tell the jury it was his idea and I was scared for my life, because he said he'd kill me if I ever told anyone, then I walk Oh, I knew...I knew. Who else do we have What Baby, don't worry about him, he's just jealous 'cause you've still got rockin' abs and a better hairline. Even if he did send that picture, what does it prove...Nothing. For all of Martin's talk of relying on each other... Garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of distrust. Our relationship had turned into what some might call... ...unhealthy. Something had to give, and ironically enough, it was the night I was making my television debut. 107. I had asked Martin to be home by eight for a big surprise. Oh, hey, come and watch. You're missing me, I'm on TV! Hurry up, the commercial's almost over! Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now shhh... Martin, for god's sake, that was their line. You think I talk like that Oh, come on, what about when we went back to your place Come on, don't be bashful. He put on some soft music and We started kissing and But, JayJay, it was really special. He loves to be called JayJay. Let me tell you, Becky, you're in for a wild ride from this Bronco. God, Martin, it was a one time thing. He was a virgin, how could I say no Believe me, she'll thank me after their wedding night. Don't be jealous. It won't happen again. It was just a goof. Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I wasn't really supposed to, you know, go all the way but Well, what does that make you 111. Oh, by the way, some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something. It's on the desk. What is it Oh, my god. No, this is exactly what he wants! What if he's working with Garson No, please, don't do this! Let me go with you! Don't do this, we can leave tonight! We'll drive to Mexico! No! Let me talk to him, he promised me he wouldn't hurt us! A few days ago! I went to try and find out what he knew! I spent the afternoon with him      M I was doing it for us! I figured he wouldn't turn us in if I... If I made him think I was... interested. No... I just made him think I would, so he wouldn't turn us in. Fuck you. I'd think you'd be a little more appreciative. Oh, like you're such a martyr for being faithful It shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter! Please Look, I'm sorry, I really am, but this isn't the answer! 114. You're hurting me! Please don't do this. Yes, hello, you've got to send a police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane right away! My father's gone crazy, I think he's going to hurt our neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry! Martin, don't! No! This is insane! You're gonna kill him! Thank God! Thank God, you came! He's...he's crazy, I told him not to! I told him to stop! Needless to say, my appearance on Absolutely Positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town. The trial was quick. Once Mom's affair with Rudell came out, the D.A. realized he had a motive and a slam dunk. HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye Since, Rudell was in a coma, the issue of my relationship with Martin was moot. Martin realized trying to pin anything on me would probably get him the chair. At his sentencing I begged for leniency. He got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life for mom's death. The outpouring of support was amazing. Martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since I was eighteen, I was allowed to live by myself. 120. I'm sorry I forgot to bring that book you wanted. You'll never guess what happened. I was voted valedictorian! The best student I know! But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss. Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor. 121. I don't know, why Oh...I wouldn't worry about that. I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them. Help us Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but I'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet. Oh...wow, like I thought you were just playing along cause I'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know You remember, Aurelio What a sweetie, I thought I might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough. It was pretty clear Garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. It just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering. Oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first...you know I'm right. 123. Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, I thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex. They don't tap these lines, do they I think I might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing...you ready No Are you sure I won't be able to come back for a few weeks. Wait, have you met someone in here! Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn't be single in here for long. I guess this means I could start dating around too Daddy, why are you saying those things! Daddy, stop! I love you! Don't say that! I love you! ...As many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. I don't know how I would have gotten through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first straight C student in school history voted Valedictorian. 125. Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and I want to wish him a speedy recovery. I spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall. While I may not have excelled in the classroom, I think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call life, have taught me a few lessons that I'd like to share with my fellow graduates. Follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. Trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine. But as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. Don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love. And I mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service. Really do it...Whenever you can. 126. I know I did, and I just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech I could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here...in front of all of you. Thank you and good luck. Like I promised, no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular, no Shakespeare shoved up your ass.

80,MARTIN,Mini's First Time,2006,True,"Yeah...uh... A dinner with a client got canceled. About the same... Is your mother around Oh. I wasn't, but thanks for the concern...You're going out on a school night Mmm...Is your homework done Mmm... Hello Sure. Everything alright in there No, that's fine, but can we get this show on the road The deluxe. Y...yes. I... that was...you were really good. I'd like to see you again, but...uh...I never got your name Ginger, I won't forget. Ginger! You forgot your... ...Jacket. Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math problems 28. I'd be happy to help you with it, if you need. So... I don't want to have to sneak around in my own house. I mean, I don't want to live under the same roof with her. CLOSE ON She wasn't as bad an actress as you think. There is Wait, you don't mean Good... 34. Ill As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife. Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented. A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt. 35. And we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country. It will be a much better life for her. Coming, honey. Diane, sugar, do you remember where you put them when you came home last night Uh, are you sure You did seem a bit tipsy. Diane, I have a meeting with Chapman, he's our biggest client Here comes the choochoo. What is going on! Carlos, what the fuck are all these flowers doing here! Diane, did you order all this! Listen, great job, but you need to give me more warning. I was at dinner with Chapman, and it's the second time I've had to re schedule. Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate! Honey You okay...Honey Diane, it's us, wake up. Mini. Diane, come on, come on. 60. Her pulse is almost gone. I...I don't know. She will if we keep this torture up. This is wrong, call an ambulance. 61. Mini We both agreed murder was out. She wouldn't have taken the pills if we hadn't Mini, for gods sake, she still has a pulse. Mini, we What Just leave her here 62. I don't know. What Speed this up No, I'm sorry, this is going somewhere I'm not prepared to go. What are you suggesting I don't think this is a good idea. Could you just pretend to have a little remorse XT. THE HOUSE  LATER. It's okay, sweetheart, everything's going to be okay. Yes Yes Oh...uh...right. Could we do this another time Thank you. Mini, it's okay...just go lie down for a moment. So after dinner and the movie, we came home at around 1130 and found her in the garage. I turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust. 69. Of course, we did that too, but I couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but... it didn't work. Yes. We never thought she'd do anything like...this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It's been a very stressful time. Yes. What Is, is that important Oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage. No, Mini and I have our own cars. Crime lab Oh, okay. Sure. I'm sorry Oh...right, no...not yet. But we haven't really looked. 71. No...of course not. But they said it's Oh, shit! The sweatsuits and goggles. Good. Really   Sure, if you want. Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you doing here udell comes over, clearly aware of how unfatherdaughter Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it. Why did you tell him! He knows. He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows! Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us together. You realize he could blackmail us If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine. And you let him in! Well, when's he coming over Tonight! I've got a dinner with Chapman. I've already cancelled Damn it! Why didn't you call me! Listen, I'll be home early so we can get the story straight. Absolutely. What would you like to know Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do I need my lawyer here Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation. Fair enough. I wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin. Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, I'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription. Again, Detective, I really can't say why she was taking these drugs. No...we led, for the most part, separate lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini. 83. Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I don't see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely disturbed person. Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst Well, that makes two of us... Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening. That's right. That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore. Yeah, he slides down Washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him. Another demerit... The Galleria. 1130. Now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night. For now Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up. We've told you everything we know.     G Well, I'm telling you the next time you have a question, it had better be because you're charging us I'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives. What the hell was I thinking, letting you talk me into this That was not routine, my dear. Sorry, it just slipped out. 86. Okay. Chill! Believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. You do understand they could go for the death penalty Hello! They don't try and spook you unless they think you did it! Well, if it was such a great plan, why am I cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide Where are you going A phone call would have been appreciated at some point. I was worried. I wasn't saying that as a dad. Before your mother and I...grew apart, I would worry if she was out late. What the hell's gotten into you I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else. Haven't you ever been in a relationship My god, you haven't. Oh, angel. Morning, Lois. Lois, I need you to reschedule the Chapman meeting... I know...Tell him...tell him it's an unavoidable emergency. What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are Yeah Thank you, Lois. Steve Charlie What, what are you doing in town Why didn't you tell me you were coming Jesus, guys, my wife just committed suicide... Fifteen years...we've been 92. Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Look at that smug prick...He's fucking with me and I will not be fucked with. My god, the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office! He was the only person at the resort who knew who we were! That son of bitch just cost me the firm I worked fifteen years to build. Detective, I told you no more questions without my lawyer. I suppose I can try. 102. I'm sorry, but this is harassment. And I never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm. Not a second. I hope you know that Good. You realize, we've got to rely on each other Exactly. We're almost home free. My lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell. I've only got one concern now. Rudell. If a jury knew we were a couple, we've both got a motive and that changes everything. 106. What Why You You went on Did, did you... You had me come home early to Rudell He let you go on I can't believe you...ththat couple, you ruined their relationship. You're a sick little twist, you know that I need some air. I think it's time I had a little chat with our neighbor Then he can't blackmail me. Wait here, I'll be right back. I said wait here. 112. He'll never leave us alone, you realize that He did When You saw him If you... And was he Please tell me you didn't. 113. Thank you, I appreciate your restraint. Who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid Huh Who was that selfless act for! Don't lecture me about fidelity! Your mother was cheating within six months of the I do's! Now, if you'll excuse me... Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you understand Just watched Mini on your show. A natural, huh 115. You son of a bitch... Where are they! Huh Don't fuck with me! The negatives! You son of a bitch! How's that feel! You like that! You thought you could have my wife and my daughter too! Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas, but not her! Not her! Go look for the negatives! We need the negatives! What are you doing! He'll tell everyone! Mini, you called them! How could you call them! It's okay, Myou can mail it. Well...uh...you have to be careful about sh...So how's school What But don't you have to be I wonder how the real valedictorian feels Is Rudell out of his coma yet Why Mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures. But if the D.A. got those pictures, you could Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet Because I've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that.

84,ROPER,Metro,1997,False,"Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... Dig in, Cozy Girl... Roper go. I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. Stay up there, Girl... Where's the damn wire! SHIT! Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post ...a car. ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... What's the suspect's name Hello, guys. Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl They're not usually graduate students. What's the rush They haven't killed anybody yet this week We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor I have to go face to face. You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded  We don't know how bad it is  The guy ripped the phone out  SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there. He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence. We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him maybe we won't lose anyone. We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death. Give me a dozen donuts. Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon. I need to get something straight first. Who's the manager When did you start keeping longer hours Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you. I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way. First I need you to point that gun away from What's your name Point the gun away from Debbie. Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out. Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City... How ya doin' ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway. Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. He didn't kill anybody, though. This is gonna hurt. It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing. I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie. Give me your gun. I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years. Because this strungout junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody. As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith. Give me Debbie. The Old Guy What kind of show of faith is that I want Debbie. You're gettin' the car. You two, leave. That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going to get your car. Oh, there's one last thing. You want a convertible or hardtop Hardtop. Manual or automatic You got it. Ronnie, why are you torturing me I can't live without you. This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you. I worship you. Ronnie, forget this what'shisname. Did you know he's already got a bad knee In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair. Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters. Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease. This Greg is really getting in my way. Please. I'm begging you. Hey, that's my car. Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight You're my hero. Deal. Tell him to give me a raise. What Depends. What's up Define concern. Your concern is heartwarming. Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside Let me see that. Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation. Additional Skills Biathelete, marathoner, lipreading, speaks Spanish... Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars. And a car. You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound. The car is part of the deal. Repoed this morning. And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background... change Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you... You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator. Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin You ever been in a hostage situation How do you feel after a shooting. It rarely has to be done. SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know. Try to remember that. Okay, Dead Eye, lesson one... Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle. A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow. Phoney Frank Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar. Yeah, okay. You worried about me, too The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization. It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player Greg Barnett. Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out. Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up. Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right. Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this. Fuck the stereo. What's that smell You want me to go up with you Good. I don't want to be late. You want anything on the game It was Warriors plus 6 this morning. Get an ambulance! window He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... Solis I want to be put on this case. I want to be put on this case. Who's running it Who's running it! Hey, hey, hey... Anything on Korda so far I don't give a damn what Solis said. If you get a lead, I want to know. Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. I'm not drunk. Yet. You heard. Can I come in That a new picture Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy He heard my voice. How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me He misses me. I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. I've proved that, didn't I Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. Something I guess I can't have anymore. You think I didn't need you Ronnie... You expecting someone This day just keeps getting better. I was just leaving. What do you got on Korda Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration How about the record room for any incident reports He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. And what about bars We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents. You guys are doing good work. I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. I don't see much progress here. Very nice... You get an A. Notice... No force required. No damage. So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco Recruited you from where With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here You don't like New York You'd never been out of New York How did you like Toronto You're a real excitable sort, aren't you I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for fast advancement. I'm not sure. Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version. Which apartment How are we gonna get him out of there Have you evacuated anyone Is the hostage injured Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that. Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here. I'm coming in. I'm not armed. I know how you feel, Ray. I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay. Let me show you something, Ray. Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. My name's Scott Roper. NOOOO!! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head You think I've never had a gun pulled on me! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it! Not the ones I'm at. Come on. Let's go for a drink. You have to. It's a tradition. You got a girlfriend Better than your pool game. You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you You living together Explain how that works. She grow up in Livingtston, too Oh, city girl. Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey Every couple of months, huh That's a lot of commitment. I admire that. No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it. Where did you hear that Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage. Lesson two, Dead Eye... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage. Yeah, you think so, but it comes up. Zack, another round. My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. He got caught in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner and the bad guy... Weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again. Some people never learn. You think you can learn, McCall What did you think I'm going to let you practice on real people First things is, don't say, What's going on Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, mannequin I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you. Second You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that It'll come. Try again. How are you going to help me I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. You could say something like, Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out. If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. Get good at it. You know the ten commandments What's the first commandment Okay, forget that. What's the main one. Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right Why So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives Let's try it again. Okay, stop. Close your eyes. What did you see Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important. Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire. Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side... You know why I like the track Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation. See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use him. See the favorite Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainerjockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think I have three words for you... Exac ta. I bought you a foursix exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks. How you doin', Marv We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second. Ronnie... Yeah, so. So what do you want... An autograph. Still needs work. Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape. That's okay. That's his style. To run late! The favorite's fading. I told you he wasn't going to run today... The four horse has got the lead! He'll be running at the quarter pole. There he goes. Yeah, first and second. Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell. The jockey! We lost. How much you wanna bet Yes! That's eight hundred bucks. About six years. My partner took me. Occasionally you lose. Roper here. I'm on my way. We gotta go. See this. Solis has me driving the shitmobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty. What do we got Any verification on numbers. What have you promised them Any good points of entry My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want. That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you. Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible. I'm going to put my hands down, okay. Yep. Is that all You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. I understand you completely. We're going to have to take this guy out. I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques. So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages... Yet. Okay. Time to give this fucker a call. This fucker's not answering. He's cutting down the visibility. It's Korda. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Shit! Where'd that shot come from Hold your fire! Damnit! to Solis Are these yours Come on! I don't know, but I've got to get on there. Pull up alongside. Sorry, go. Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here. You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter. What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off Could I kill you then Could I kill you then We do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling. I wanted to get this out of the way. As a matter of fact, I do. I was going to catch the last half on TV. You having dinner with Mr. Baseball That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much I've been craving that stuff all week. What do you think What are you talking about This is it. This is the stuff right here. Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar. Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. What would you say if I quit gambling It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world. Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again. What about Greg What are you gonna tell him When Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner for some wine. He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. You okay! Stay. Shut the fuck up! Get on your radio and get the police here. If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed. Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner. You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you! Whata ya got Can you get a net out here McCall! McCall! Where are we going It might have happened no matter who was up there. Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them. That it is. I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it. You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave. You've got to decide that for yourself. I've lost three. One of them was my partner. I think about them every time I go into a situation. There's a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads, and the bitch of this job is that we expect to go out every day and do the impossible  to somehow control all this craziness... and we can't. Nobody's faulting you for this, McCall. My advice is you let yourself off the hook. Let's get out of here. It has a nice nose. That's my favorite. Why don't you give us a minute. You like this place I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about. For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff... ...Let me just show you. Tahiti. Oh you thought I was going to ask you... Oh, nonononono... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out... I assume you're having your usual the air dried venison. How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy. When I get old and fat, I'm moving to Europe. Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie. Korda escaped. Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow. Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff. Use your imagination. Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. It's better if you stay inside. Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. Time to get movin'. Ronnie Ronnie, where are you Time to go. Ronnie. She's gone. That son of a bitch. If he... He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head. He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her. That's a chance I gotta take. Frank, this guy is a psychopath and he's got Ronnie. It's the only way I'm going to get close to him. They'll never approve it, you know that. Besides, I involve the department and she's dead. I got one chance with this guy, Frank, alone. He killed Sam and he'll kill her. What if it were Mary You'd break every fucking rule in the book... wouldn't you I owe you one, Frank. Good question. Korda! Where the hell are you, McCall Shit. Where are you Where is she, Korda I want to see her. I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me. Satisfied It's all there. Only the jewels, Korda, you've got my word. Right there, the one in front... yeah, that one. Toss it. Yeah. I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it. I've kept my end. Ronnie first. Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this. McCall, stop him, stop the car! McCall! McCall, shoot the son of a bitch! It's all over, babe, it's all over. Stay here, don't move. Do it! McCall, you all right Stay put. Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake! Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass! Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit. I'll have another Pena Colada. And this time could you shave the ice, please. Hmm Hmm up Yeah. sitting up A deeper level the pass Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality. I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'. I'm talking about... What are you talking about You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked' Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the M word. You crazy With all those people around The hell I am! First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits tongs or thongs or whatever you call them  with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.

Put our best man highground, Twenty degree down angle. There's your answer. He's smart. And doing a very good job of it. Come on. Give us one clean shot. They're out. They switched clothes.

There's obviously some mistake. I have a cousin who has had runins with the law. Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation. Clarence Teal. Your cough seems to be better. Lieutenant... Do you believe that story about Robert Johnson... That he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads If you weren't family I'd kill you. You told Antonucci that shit came from me. You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you... To be a walking advertisement. Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door! You don't want to know. God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now. Leave town They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want. It's not your fault you're stupid. You don't have to come here. Alright, Roper. You want to come... come. Stay there. Are you in charge, Roper I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again. I want a plane waiting at the airport.

INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN  MOLLY  GRAHAM  NIGHT are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes. I have to. Because it's his bad luck to be special. Nobody's better with evidence.

Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something, Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through...

What do we do What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. It says 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida.

90,GRAHAM,Manhunter,1984,False,"I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions What else did you keep out of the papers Somebody hurt him No. The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that. I am all right. As long as they're dead... Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. What did he want And you said I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma I got a diploma and everything. We have it good, don't we What the hell can I do If I were of her face I don't care. He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. Yeah. .. In this hatchery Forty to fifty. Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed. Thanks for the lift. That's right. Thanks. Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house with all of the Atlanta Police department crime scene postings Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side. INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN  WIDE  NIGHT Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts playing through the bushes in the side yard.., then the light appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been undisturbed. intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were postmortem. Then he went toward the children's room. Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot... Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be postmortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead And before he put the boys back in their beds There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog recorder When they were dead  except possibly Mrs. Leeds  he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead Molly It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you... You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience Did you open their eyes There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her. You took off your glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU, YOU SONOFABITCH! You touched her with your bare hands! And then you put the gloves back an. And you wiped her down! While your gloves were off DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES THEIR DEAD EYES! Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints He is good. Bur not as good as Price. Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. The report didn't mention nails and eyes. Mrs. Leeds was a goodlooking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead. He may have a history of biting barroom fights or child abuse. That's all we know about. Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot. Sex murder three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... ... that's all I have. Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. I call him a monster. What about the dog Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upsidedown. The impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from Lounds. Keep the fuck away from me! Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go. WIDER CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and lands on all fours. ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls... Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack. Crawford then ... I'm going to see Lecter. To recover the mind set. Hey, baby! Where are you None you'd notice. I'm lonely... Tell me about yourself. Let's keep it the daytoday stuff. How's Kevin Eating junk food. They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. I have to see somebody. Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. Blue, then. Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit brown for all I care... Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .. I love you... I'm not a doctor. I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. No. I want to see Lecktor now. I keep getting it for Christmas. I got it. Thank you. Stuart is fine. No. Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Very interesting, even to a layman. You've read the transcript. It's all there. You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are. You had disadvantages. You're insane. I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... Yes. Yes. No. Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why That's interesting. Yes. I'd considered it. I want your opinion. When you do have one I'd like to hear it. I haven't decided yet. No. Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. Block her off, Mitch... Have any single men asked to look at it Uhuh. I love it. Sweet Jesus, yes come on, can. ... after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited. You used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see. You watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming. When night came, you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the lights go out one by one. And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU WATCHED THEM ALL GODDAMN DAY LONG! ! That's why you like houses with big yards, the easier to see them I'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints. I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used. The mark Yes. Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds SARAH                            CRAWFORD Special Agent Crawford's       No. The killer's not in office..                       the Single Print Index. He must never have been printed. Who did he ask for ...so how do I play him, Sidney This is Will Graham. Can I help you I don't understand. Do you know something about that I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things . Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in He's righthanded. He's misunderstood. He's very strong physically. He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. I don't want to do that, You tell me. You have a man in custody Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You... What is it Where did you get it! Can you read it to me After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man. Ninhydran Boosted with heat The main thing is how was Lecktor to reply. He doesn't have anything to cut with. We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector I don't know any other paper that carried it... Personal ads Bowman Will Graham, Jack Crawford... Read it. That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... Twentyfive minutes. We won't make it in time. Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon . Run it. We will feel sick for a very long time. Who is it What'd it say Tell me now. Get me a plane... Get me a plane! I won't be here. ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's a precaution... Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. What is he Afraid to leave you alone with me now' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping . I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was.., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait . Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him. I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay. No. ...after a while. ... yes. Kevin it's the ugliest thing in the world. Huh Slick as hell. I remember. Yes. I said this is too good to live... You don't recommend what, Sidney If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. That's what you were thinking, isn't it Sidney, he doesn't read the Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the Tattler. And I want this over with... Fast. I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries... He's not as intelligent. What have we missed The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . And probably had sexual relations with his mother... All right. Let's shoot the pictures . Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious. No. Pretty well. Glaser Safety Slugs Kevlar Second Chance. Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' Let's walk the route. Goddammit!!! You haven't smoked in two years. No. I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not tell you. No. Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time. I have to go back to Birmingham. No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. I'll come and get you afterwards... Molly. ... I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile... And do what Read about the next family in the morning paper In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home This ends when I make it over. Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney Answer me that...! I'm sorry, too... Coffee ... It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you. Because I'm losing all this... CUT TD I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. What's it narrow down to That's narrow When I'm done. It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian, too... Yes. Is Molly there I know... 'Out in the good air...' Tell her I called. What do you want I'm worn out with you crazy sonsof bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. Fight what I don't believe in God. Why does it feel good I enter. The glass cutter. I lick the suction cup. The piece of glass I take out is mine. House is mine . I walk up these stairs. I pass childrens' toys. The children mean nothing to me... I am soundless. I move to the door. I step into the room... You will be better than anything... anything I have ever known. As I see me in your eyes.., as I see me accepted there. Reflected there in mirrors . And you, you are the fuel for my changing... as this event becomes one more step towards what I am becoming that is different than what I have ever been before... As I see me, accepted by you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes... He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. It's very important. It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... How do I know! He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses, If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him. There has to be. He's a very shy boy... Something Lecktor said. It's not over yet. You wanna watch this or what! That's why the boltcutter. He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door. But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore... From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door . There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter. So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or... Don't talk to me!! It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom Have one of the guards down there call me. Do it. You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ... You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock... And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man! See the woman The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want. The doggy doesn't have a collar. But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you And you know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause... YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS! Haven't you, my man We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. Have him peel the top label back. It does, doesn't it Parking permits...

That's selfish, huh Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone He thinks you want him to look at evidence.

And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong Do you remember what you said Time is luck, Will. I know the value of our days... Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back. Can I have one of your cigarettes I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.

94,LECKTOR,Manhunter,1984,False,"That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. Did you get my card And how is Officer Stuart The one who was the first to see my basement. Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will Of course, you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Secondraters, the lot. And A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will Do you know how you did it' No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will Pray tell. Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. Then how did you catch me, Will What disadvantage. You're very tan, Will. Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. Do you have the file with you Pictures let me have them,, and I might consider it. Do you dream much, Will You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think. There is a very shy boy, Will. What were the yards like Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing. It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you I don't have one right now. May I keep the file I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number Do you know how you caught me, Will Do you know how you caught me The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike. You want the scent Smell yourself. Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished. Attendant hesitates. Then he leaves. Lecktor is allowed to call his attorney in privacy. picks up the phone and punches in his number. Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please Thank you. Dr. Sidney Bloom, please. What's his secretary's name again... Hi, Linda. .. Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine  Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number. I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me. I'LL bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone. Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G. We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Ms. Will Graham. Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too Thank you very much. You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court. I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good And why shouldn't it feel good! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time! You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders. It feels good because if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is powerful... God's a champ! He got a hundred and sixty Philippines in one plane crash two months ago...

We'll go. Just something you could tell us, first. Do you remember his name What can you tell me about him It's important. Can you give me any more description than that I believed her, Pete. I believed her the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann. It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything. I better keep looking. I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel. It's got to make sense some way. How is it back there Arlyn Page was probably an alias. She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price. She may have been from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I can give you a list of people who knew her, if that would help to Is he claiming the body Yeah, what You've got to get up. I looked it up. Yeah. I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead. The same as Jane McKenna. The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time. Just let me know when you are going out and where How can you do it to yourself Ligourin How could you do it You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women. No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it No, you can find some other way. Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to It's been a full day. We did this before. I don't like getting splashed. Bree DISSOLVE DISSOLVE DISSOLVE DISSOLVE DISSOLVE DISSOLVE Go back to sleep. My bed. Mm. Yup. Four ninetyseven, Jane McKenna I thought there'd be more. I don't know. It looks familiar to me. But what reason could he have What possible reason I knew Tom never wrote that letter. I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition and I don't believe he's alive. I don't believe Tom's alive. But why Why Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please. I'll be sending you on a report tonight. It's not so bad. Would you like to know what's in it The report. I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places  I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around. He could've been murdered. No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something It's in the report. I wanted to give it to you first. All right. Goodbye, Pete. He was always at their house on holidays. Tom and Holly always had him, over on holidays. Tom felt sorry for him  his whole life was work. Tom felt sorry for him. Yeah. What am I supposed to say Well, here's your gold star. What I was wondering what that was. Don't touch anything. Drop it. Stay out of there. Listen to me It's all right. I've been expecting something. Bree Go down in my room. Go down in my room and wait. Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me. That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. It didn't work out just that way. I left them here. I was doing some work here. Nobody's seen that. He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 300 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago. Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment. Where'd you spend last night I called Trina. Bree, what's actually happened It wasn't that bad. Why couldn't you stay here with me Trask wants to talk with you. Trask wants to talk with you. Well there's a couple Well as a matter of Yeah. Yeah, two things Pete, that Yeah. It wasn't Tom. It wasn't Tom that broke in the room. Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0 Tom was an AB. No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was  but proves it wasn't Tom. Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture. Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew. Someone's been doing all these things. Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book. Callgirls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time. I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on EastRiver Drive  he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead. I want a look at it anyhow. All right, but I'm going to see that list. No, but Bree does. She's negotiating for me. Bree Daniel. Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street. Just send me a money order. Well Bree I'm always getting surprises. I don't want you to do this. Please. I said I don't want you to do this. No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch. Please Hello Trask, I don't get that. Who told you, his secretary Has someone checked his hotel He always stays at the I'll look around, I'll call you back. Bree Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her Will you check other people she might call Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou. Yeah Nothing yet, Trask I'm going down the list. I've tried Spangler's office and Spangler's home I just get his message service. I'll keep then  grimly I may have steered Cable that way. I told him Bree was dealing for me, for Jane McKenna's book. Have you found any Yeah. Did she leave a number This is a police call don't make me take time to prove it. Did she leave a number What is the number What is the number Come on. Come on. I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland  he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife. Mm. Mm. Wait. No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. I am. About what I don't think so. They don't scare me any more. Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it. OK.

98,CABLE,Klute,1971,True,"interrupts It's been almost a year! Tom Grunemann's been missing for a year. And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you. But you don't find it worth much effort. You wonder why we thought of Klute Frankly He's interested. She wouldn't be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict. All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann where does that get you Then, close the case. Where, how You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom. Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday I'll fill them in on things. I think you're homesick. I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I'll be back here again Thursday I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you. Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time. I read your report. I had to go along with it  the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me. I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well any new developments You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that I'm sorry. I don't understand. It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he Some mistake perhaps that You must be discouraged. That who You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom. You were hired to look for Tom, not someone. What You were hired to look for Tom. I can't follow you. No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann. Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom all right, I'll see that you're paid off the case is closed. Why would they deal with you You don't know these people. I can talk it over possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man Suppose I meet you there a half hour before. No, I'd  like to be in on it. Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night. Can't we talk together reasonably, just  ordinarily I know you're expecting some kind of  extravagant behavior, but believe me  do you believe me We can talk All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a  position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a  certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book. Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her list of  of persons. I was told you're negotiating for it on behalf of That was what Klute told me  you were negotiating for him to buy that list. And I'm in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can. Do you understand I'd like you to acquire it on my Miss Daniel, do you not understand Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether you understand me. Is this something Klute just invented Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel does Klute know about me You have no idea what I'm talking about. No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well  Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it You people know nothing about pain. I've got no idea what I shall do. I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not. It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see Tom Grunemann discovered me  we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the  the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see Excuse me Miss Daniel Oh no, I don't think You're willing to listen You want me just to keep talking That's what you do, isn't it you make a man feel accepted. That's what you all do. Your stock in trade a man's weakness. Why don't you ask for mercy My God, what mercy has anyone given me You're a person of no value, you have no value Is that contempt Is it No, I'm the one who feels contempt.",815,"[interrupts, year, Tom, Grunemann, missing, year, FBI, offer, report, bore, find, worth, effort, wonder, thought, Klute, Frankly, interested, reliable, narcotics, addict, right, suppose, Tom, Grunemann, close, case, finished, telling, offer, Tom, said, Dumper, clearly, Tom, Yes, Evvie, thanks, Gentlemen, sorry, flying, Pennsylvania, Friday, fill, things, think, homesick, camp, weekend, Nice, right, touch, fall, air, skim, frost, early, mornings, peaceful, John, Thursday, touch, Lieutenant, thank, Sorry, meet, pressed, time, read, report, idea, wild, goose, chase, Tom, country, know, summer, place, camp, telephone, morning, sent, messenger, trying, way, Chicago, important, meeting, tonight, new, developments, said, Trask, arranging, laboratory, work, Police, laboratory, sorry, understand, Tom, said, ripped, pictures, mistake, discouraged, said, possible, connection, Tom, Page, girl, told, Tom, hired, look, Tom, hired, look, Tom, follow, ridiculous, Tom, Grunemann, Klute, Company, interest, Tom, Grunemann, Solely, exclusively, find, Tom, right, paid, case, closed, deal, know, people, talk, possibly, money, meeting, man, Suppose, meet, half, hour, like, Tomorrow, tomorrow, night, talk, reasonably, ordinarily, know, expecting, kind, extravagant, behavior, believe, believe, talk, right, ordinary, matter, man, position, respect, feel, personally, uncomfortable, connected, certain, kind, woman, sure, understand, like, buy, Jane, McKenna, book, black, book, Jane, McKenna, list, persons, told, negotiating, behalf, Klute, told, negotiating, buy, list, position, pay, good, deal, understand, like, acquire, Miss, Daniel, understand, Miss, Daniel, tell, understand, Klute, invented, trap, Miss, Daniel, Klute, know, idea, talking, frightened, pretending, Klute, knows, everybody, know, tell, matter, people, know, pain, got, idea, shall, going, hurt, absolutely, puzzles, badly, terrible, things, consider, terrible, man, killed, people, want, accident, Tom, Grunemann, discovered, business, discovered, Jane, McKenna, suppose, contempt, saw, face, certainty, sooner, later, use, Company, endured, long, Excuse, Miss, Daniel, Oh, think, willing, listen, want, talking, man, feel, accepted, stock, trade, man, weakness, ask, mercy, God, mercy, given, person, value, value, contempt, feels, contempt]",0.060810810810810814,0.0945945945945946,0.05405405405405406,0.10135135135135136,0.06756756756756757,0.17567567567567569,0.18243243243243243,0.0945945945945946,0.05405405405405406,0.11486486486486487,"[-1.09352931e-01  1.78560050e-01 -2.01730896e-01 -3.71388523e-02

99,TRASK,Klute,1971,False,"We first hold her under surveillance expectin your boy Grunemann to show up there. Didn't. Then we bagged  we arrested her on a CP charge, convicted, two month's women's city prison, offer to reduce sentence, she cooperated. Four interrogations. She thought she remembered Grunemann  from those letters from before, she made that connection  but she hadn't seen him since and couldn't identify his photograph and she Oh a good call girl, she'll turn sixseven hundred tricks a year. The faces get blurred. And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that. So it's I guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her. But you know, that Ever done any missing person's work Man, just a poor pretty little hooker, like to be an actress What you lookin' to get from her You think she's got Grunemann hid somewhere, the attic, feedin him soup Or maybe he's hidin in a dark alley and he'll jump on her and you jump on him. And third place, even if she does know somethin' she's right, she don't have to talk to you. You don't have police power, you can't make her. Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday. He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything. They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull propellers washed it up on top. It'll go to the Examiner. But I don't see nothin that means nothin. That's how the other one died, you know. In the water. Well Think this is our guy Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody. Now the next cat. Mm Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance. What else do you know We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder  there's not even a body. Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man  it kept things goin'. Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin' else first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane McKenna Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing. He graduated from high school at 14 college at 16  no friends The kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18  married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. The marriage lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we know why he killed Grunemann  he found out Cable was a dumper Cable couldn't take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna  she wanted to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go anydamnwhere. Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway. It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here. If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think  all he really had to do was write us a letter. He sure chalks up a lot of flight time. Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up. A few more days. We know who did this. No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him  also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page. Now there's a picture I'd like you to Well we're pretty We don't want to just lock him up we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more. I guess he figured it was better.

Who Gee. Why Honest Dew yew hayuv ahdentifikyshun You're not police or FBI you're just a private investigator And you just want to ask me a few questions and I take acting classes with Lee Tainter and I was in two of his workshop type productions, Uncle Vanya and the girl in Five Characters here  and then of course I have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the tradefair work  but naturally I feel ready for something more, well you know, sustain business Thank you very much. Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm trying to stay out of it. Well try to get someone else Marty and if I change my mind  sure hon, bye. Marta Hi. Bree. Hi. Well I could come over tonight if you'd like  if there's no one else. I really want to just talk to you. Hi Oh You scared me, Mr. Faber. Oh thank you. It's good to see you. Well  could we do it first and then just talk Well  well I'm just back. And I must tell you  something quite wonderful. And Cannes was quite fun, quite and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me  but a young man can be so silly And then one night  at the gaming tables  well I just saw him. A stranger  looking at me  and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been May I It's so Not young he wasn't young  gray at the temples, he  well actually he looked like you. And nobody could tell me who he was an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or  but I felt it stirring inside me, this  this wild, pagan feeling And next day at the beach  our beach pavilion  I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow  somehow Whyn't you just cut out Oh you bastard. Is it the shakedown hon You picked a loser, I just don't have it. If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip I'd be back on Park Avenue I could support the whole National Guard! Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean another month with the bulldykes. Look, I told the police everything I don't even remember the schlub! They showed me that one. I understand it's Grunemann, but I told them, I just don't remember. A family sort of man. Isn't that sweet. Well it could be any one of them bubi I get to see them all. Look  please  will you just try to get it from my side A year ago. I was in the life fulltime. I was living on Park with leather furniture and a million dresses. Then they dropped on me, the fuzz, they caged me  they started asking me about a man, some man, I'm supposed to have seen a year before that. Two years ago, two. He could be in Yemen! A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters  I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he when  well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper Dumpers they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me that'd be about two years ago. OK Tommybaby, AllieAllieinfree kid, I got the gumdrops. You remind me of my uncle. Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it he I can't say he was anybody! So  OK  that's all Well could I have them back now hon  those tape recordings you've got downstairs  OK  and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and Just phone calls, right They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves Look  I'm sorry  I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings. I'm sure this will amuse you I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or  well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little  trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for  do you see things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves it's got nothing to do with Bree Daniel. Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you're in town Well I just love Ted and I'd love to meet you  you have a very nice voice  but I just Well I'm having a chat with a very nice cop. Actually not a real cop he's a private inves Most of them. How would I remember You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie they just take the money. Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that. You saw that, goddamn you You saw it He's seventy. His wife's dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, I'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what Klute, tell me, what's your bag Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young  children  or get your chest walked around with highheeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle Or You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things you perverted hypocrite square bastards. Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse. Mm Oh, he was my old man. We broke up. What This I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room Or let me get you someone I have terrific friends, wild. Gee. I've had men pay two hundred dollars for me  here, you're turning down a freebie. You can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that. You've changed your mind You do want to play I go on rounds. You go see agents  or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies  commercials  you don't get work, you just go around. And they're always polite  show people  they say thank you very much. You lie there covered with blood, smiling, they say Well do you think it was him Can't you get him You asked me where I got that date with the dumper  Frank sent me on it. He never told me. What did you expect Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each. Frank  Klute. Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He knows you were my pimp. Yeah Frank, I know that. Did you like my friend Frankie Didn't he tell you what you wanted About the dumper, didn't he tell you that Well  she's dead. I thought you were going back to the apartment. Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. How come Is there anything more I could What're you gonna do next What do I do meanwhile  wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me You said it was! Oh  wait  oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I  oh clever oh you smart, tricky hick. Hey, but did we get to you, Klute A little Us city folks The sin, the glitter, the wickedness Goodbye. What the hell do you mean, pathetic It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof. Oh, don't be a doodoo. Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me  the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommybaby Look, if you don't use it somebody else just will. And you've done your whole bit with me, your entire duty, and so now this is my thing. So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say, enjoy. Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks Is it more just having power over someone  so you don't really need to Who the hell are you, buttoning me up I knew it, I knew it, a killer. DISSOLVE Oh lover  oh you thrill me  oh, it's beautiful  oh yes, yes  oh like that, like that, yes DISSOLVE What's the matter hon You were great. Terrific. A tiger. Well what're you down about You mean because you didn't get me there You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time  but never with a John. And I'm sorry I can't stay and learn your special little games. And I certainly don't want you to feel bad about this  losing your virtue all of a sudden  because I sort of knew you would. As I said, like everyone, right Besides  you can always tell yourself you made me come downstairs. Ta, luv. Why Why  please, why  Why lose, why look Why hate and give and want and love Why get, grieve, g gug  gug Why  I want to know what. When Arlyn Page. Frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime. Arlyn had a very big habit  heroin she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now you won't find her. I can make that in a lunch break! Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me  you decided you liked it, after all, the other night you'll hang around for seconds Joanie  Mike, hi Hi Pat. A new daddy. I'n he cute Trina this is Klute. I told you about him. Uh uh. Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page. She was with you after she left Frank. Gil What the hell do you think's the matter. I could wait for you someplace. Then you don't need me. You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars. Arlyn Honey Look, it's all right. Arlyn, it's all right. Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions  something you could help us about. Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie  Jane sent me a Dumper Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns Did he come around often Well hello  come on in. How Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you Why What if i go out on tricks  you wanna come along You could sit and read the National Geographic. I don't get you. I told you before, you wouldn't understand. No. Arlyn was a junkie I'm not on junk! You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything you get out! If I asked you something, would you not laugh  asked you to look at something I thought it was maybe changing shape or something. Look  I hate everybody and I'm sorry for everybody and I'm scared all the time. Look, I don't know either. It's like the only thing I know how to do  I feel safe. Please. No. Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right. I'm still scared. I mean different but still. Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed Oh! I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. Oh The son of a bitch seduced me! I know it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something Guess! I do not love him. All right. Loneliness. Well  separated. From other people. Forgotten. Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right But the truth is, I don't belong. Do you always have to repeat Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me  and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me  you know I'm all screwed up. The truth is I hate them they must hate me. All right, the money. All right, not the money. A kind of puton. It gets things back together. Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattlecalls, a tryout. I mean before  before I got this job  and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me. I said that. Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely  you know, the hate  or plunging So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is. And it's not real and you don't have to even like them  you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe  you know I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you Is that all you have to say Well, I told him I wouldn't  uh go there any more. I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore. Spangler says we have a relationship. You and I  a relationship. Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. You suppose he's a married fella He got in my clothing! Oh. Oh. Oh look what he did in them. My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. Right back at the start, right You said it was over, right You said not to worry any more, all over, right Ah, Schmendrick  what's the scam Oh zippidydoo, they'll find my fingerprints. Can I go in I need some stuff. With Trina. Maybe I wasn't there when you called. How do you know how bad it was Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that! Hey  look officer  I can explain everything. It was just you know, everything all of a Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it So do I. Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide. You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that. Why isn't he locked up Is that why Klute didn't tell me What was better I made better bait Is that what he set me up for Everything he's told me from the beginning  don't worry, don't I don't have to look at anything. I don't have Oh no. Grunemann I've looked at him a Oh! Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it. Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all.

No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source. Nate stares at him ... then laughs.       Frank doesn't. Why not. I've lived in jungles all my life They ain't Chinese. A handful of betterarmed American sentries at the perimeter of the farm. CIA. Frank, Nate and the others hang back as one of the Thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas. C56    EXT.

An lawyer carrying papers clipped with a 10 bill, comes past Richie, who's sitting with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with. You show me after supper. Is that right. 76   INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE  LATER  DAY                           76 The wonderful noise continues downstairs as Frank leads his mother on a tour of the upstairs. The place is a showroom of traditional Americana. This is your room. Mrs. Lucas is   in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its furnishings.    It's unlike anything she's used ever seen not Graceland   exactly  but not far off. Her eyes settle on an old vanity   dotted with French perfume bottles. I had it made. From memory. I remember. She's stunned. Touches the reproduction of the vanity her son last saw more than thirty years ago. The man I worked for ran one of the biggest companies in New York City for almost fifty years. 78   EXT. HARLEM  DAY                                             78 As Frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk, the Towncar that was parked at the Teaneck house, driven by Frank's body guard, Doc, follows alongside at the same pace they walk. I was with him every day for fifteen of them, looking after him, taking care of things, protecting him, learning from him. The brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave to Frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes. Bumpy was rich, but never white   man rich. Why Because he didn't own the    company. He thought he did. He didn't.     He only managed it. Someone else owned    it. So they owned him. Nobody owns me. Because I own my company. INTERCUT Feminine hands stamp small packets of blue cellophane with the words Blue Magic' And my company sells a product that's better than the competition's at a price that's lower.

What matters in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came from. For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all sugar from the container onto his plate. You are what you are and that's one of two things. You're nothing ... or you're something. Understand what I'm saying The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the nowempty glass container. Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up. I'll be right back. Hey, Tango, what's up.    I was just thinking about you. 38. 83   CONTINUED                                                       83 I was looking at the jar and you know what I didn't    see nothing in it. Yeah, that's right. Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street. Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the jar and sets it next to the body. For the cops. Should be enough. Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar. That basically's the whole picture right there. 84   INT.

You look like fuckin Jackie Fox. You like Jackie You want to be Superfly Go work for him, end up in a cell with him. Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt, adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him The guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one. That's not who you want to be. You and Jackie were talking about me I'm taking you shopping tomorrow. You go shopping every day.    Like a girl. 97   EXT.

How much you owe Sure.   Don't worry about it. Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan.       You don't owe me nothing. Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc knows the look. Gets up. 99   INT.

I want to beat it. Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner  Javy Rivera  come past a seedy motel office where a TV shows another report about Bumpy Johnson. Legend   New Jersey A motel clerk looks up, glimpses the sledgehammer 6. 7   CONTINUED                                                         7 He knows me, he'll take it from me. I've known him since high school. You bit my fuckin hand Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The paramedics manage to pull him away. All right.   Get lost.    Get out. Campizi slinks out of the car. Richie and Rivera follow after Newsboy Moriarty's accountant's car. 27   EXT. PARKING LOT  LATE AFTERNOON                              27 They tail the car into a lot, park and watch the accountant leave his car and get into another car that's parked there. Let's see who comes for the car. 28   EXT. PARKING LOT  NEWARK  NIGHT                              28 All the other cars are gone. Rivera climbs into Richie's with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can. You called for the warrant     Where are they We saw him with the slips, Javy. Yes, I do, and so do you, don't give me that bullshit I got night school. Not when it's less. Than what I make now. They do in the Prosecutor's Office. Three thousand less. Fuck this Check inside. Rivera may as well the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely Javy ... Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside. Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money stacks of it rubberbanded together, spilling from grocery bags  more than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes 29   EXT. PARKING LOT  RICHIE'S CAR  LATER  NIGHT                  29 Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out at the car with the money in it. Eventually This isn't a couple of bucks. We're talking about principle We're fucked either way. Yes, we are. Nine hundred and eighty thousand. I'm sorry. It couldn't be avoided. Next weekend I'll be able to take him. She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at one of the other  betterlooking  moms in the park. What   Where Your sister's. In Vegas He glances away to a sound shattering glass.        Some teen agers breaking bottles on the ground. You can't move to Vegas.     Not with Michael anyway. Hey, you want to shut up over there The teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's hard with the constant noise. No court will allow it for one thing. I won't allow it. When am I supposed to see my son Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las Vegas. What's he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that What are you thinking Goddamn it The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you gonna do, old man, it's four against one. I told you nice to shut the fuck up. Now I'm gonna kill you. He pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the others. All instinctively try to cover their heads. 21. 49      CONTINUED                                                       49 Pick up the fuckin glass!

Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or stoned, sits alone at a table with a CocaCola and surveys the activity Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase. His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder. The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself Who.

CEMETERY  MORNING                                        A330 Frank's car winds up the road of the cemetery. The surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks. 330    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS  MORNING                          330 Several black and white and undercover cars approach, sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars and hands Richie the search warrant. 116. 331    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS  MORNING                        331 The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below, no matter how routine A woman pushing a stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on bikes, old men resting on a graffiticovered bench. The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers. 332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS  DAY           332 Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut. Debrisstrewn, graffiticovered. A333   EXT. CEMETERY  CONTINUED  DAY                             A333 Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance. 333    INT. STAIRWELL  FLOORS  SOUTH TOWER  DAY                  333 Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go. Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the sound fades. 334    INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY  DAY                                334 Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it a couple of guys with a sawedoff shotguns sitting outside a closed door. They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks up to the guys with the guns. What kind of trees are these Frank looks at the trees, then at Richie, with equal serenity. Thank you, your Honor.   Ladies and gentlemen 343   INT. COUNTY JAIL  INTERVIEW ROOM  DAY                        343 Maybe.

Then you got nothing to worry about. I got more than that. I got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block. Is it Tony the Bug.     Benny TwoSocks. Carmine Camanetti. They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family. Which you all but put out of business. They have everything to do with you. And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent. You don't Black businessman like you Of course you do. But once you're gone, things can return to normal. Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too. You know what you have to do. I'll take them, too.   I want them all. 123. 343   CONTINUED                                                     343 They're not. Not the ones in business with you. They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours. I can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what I can promise. I believe it. I want to know everyone   you've met for the last twenty years.    Everyone you sold to. Every cop you ever    paid off. Every one who ever stole from   you. Every one you remember. 124. 343   CONTINUED                                                     343 What is What Sneakers.

He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame. Down Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings past his head shattering the door We gonna stay with him or the car Whatever they do, they'll have to decide quick. Think he made us Richie doesn't know. Glances at his watch.      Cranes in his seat to look behind them. I just called. I called and walked back here and ten seconds has gone by.

We need to keep this cash cow alive. Jimmy Racine comes in  sees Trupo  and leaves  but not before Trupo has seen him.

Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly What're you doing counting this in front of everybody Are you out of your fuckin mind Take it into a room. Now.

Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much temptation for the feebleminded. Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective. Doesn't matter. It's fucked up. You're right.

111,STEPHEN,Backdraft,1991,False,"It doesn't go like that. If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE. Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right. And DIE! Fireman shit Firehouse. Dad! Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it So you're going to fight fires now, huh Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother. Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company. a hue One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian... Got a cause The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home. It's comin' along... want a beer It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub. What, you've never seen one before It works. People actually used to pay you for this Sheep don't count. That was never proved. Why'd you come here, Brian What is it with you, man, huh How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up That scotch bullshit Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz You were bankrupt, man. I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here  someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie  that I don't think is going to make it. Thanks for the speakers. Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like. I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow. You're too late, probie. Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some backup. Be gentle. Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh You're doing it wrong. Stay beside me. No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on. Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling. I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam us! Let's go! Ya love it, probie Hook us up to a standpipe.

Take Tim and do a search. Don't you fold on me now, man. Clear the hose for me. You all right Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me. You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before. I told you to stay next to me! What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right. Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty two days a month off sounded pretty good twelve weeks ago, huh interrupting C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose... Hey! Swayzak! We almost lost a whole company up there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back up since you closed '33. And we really appreciate it, the guys and me. Honest. I know you've got my vote for mayor.

Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose. Better be good. Bye, boys. Clean the toilets. Okay, company dismissed.  See ya guys tonight at Fitzgerald's retirement party. You want a ride Brian there See ya tonight. Hey. I gotta change the view... Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper especially if it's bullshit  he owes the company a drink. In fact... ...I'll have a double. On the hero. Whatever... Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean... Jackson. What's wrong with right now He's your son for christ's sake. He's ...Yeah You can't talk about my brother like that... Leave me alone! No. I need a drink. I'm okay... leave me alone... Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know I don't think I can get up. Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too. ...Adcox, those guys...they don't get it... it isn't the goddamn promotion... or dad... I'm not my old man, y'know No fire's gonna get me... I don't give a shit about being a captain... it's just... it's just they don't trust me anymore... breath ...they don't trust me anymore... If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. I could take my own goddamn shoes off... You're such a pain in the ass... You've always been a pain in the ass... Jesus, it's too damn bright in here...

You're not breaking any records, Brian. Your shoulder. Like this! Come on! Pick it up! Run, damn you! Roll the hose. You heard me. You got a problem with drilling, probie Roll the hose. Well, thank God for fires... Don't take that kind of shit from it! Don't let it know you're scared! Come on! Ready Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us. Now! You okay That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way. You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today What do you say, Brian, huh Time to move on That's just about enough, guys, okay Here. Dry yourself off. Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game. Brian, look Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't get half the shit he's talking about, but then everybody says the same thing about me. Who the hell knows Fixing my roof. Where's Sean Oh yeah How's he doing Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried... I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night especially since I don't remember much of it Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something. Sorry I hit Jackson. He treats you okay I treated you better. Coffee Nah, I gotta go. He's out. Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror. Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong. In a fire Never. Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't  I just couldn't... You know what I realized today I can't remember my dad's face anymore. There's pictures of him staring at me everywhere I go, but the guy behind them... he's gone... I'll see ya around, Helen. Where is it Wonderful. If the doors open and it's hot, don't get out. It's here. Want to learn something Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.

Oh, you're so very sly, but so am I... ...Listen to it... you can tell when a wall cracks which way it's gonna jump... you can hear the doors breathe if they're hot... Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... that means it's hiding... staying sleepy... one of these doors... Easy... no hurry... you're not going anywhere... Did you check the door for heat, Tim Tim Tim!

Timwenttothefireandnowhe doesn'thaveaface. I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep... I... It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...

112,BRIAN,Backdraft,1991,False,"Who asked you You wouldn't let me die, would you, Dad Sure! Dad... If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing. I want another shot, Sir. If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top I need another one, sir. No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir. See you Monday. Sir. Completely out of control. A beer, Willy! It's in my blood, Willy. Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need. Management were pin heads. Coffee sucked. I was ahead of my time. Engine 115, right Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments. Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station. Mrs. Viatkus... Jennifer. You look great. Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today. So... I see you're still in the neighborhood. Yeah What have you been up to Really No kidding. Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends. Backdraft. I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me. Not likely. Hey, you forgot... this. Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man It's Uncle Brian. Y'know. Spinach We don't need no stinking spinach. Remember Hellooo... Hi, Helen. Man, you look great. Four months.

Been ripping off fire stations Bachman Turner Overdrive rack ...Buffalo Springfield... Stephen Bishop Oh man... My God, an actual operating 8track. In the Field Museum once. It worked when you were in sixth grade. Millions, Stephen  And sexual favors. Yeah What about Laura I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment.

You don't know me So that's it Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood There's only so much technology can do. box Thanks for the beer. Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt... I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know. Goddamn it, Stephen... I'm Brian. I'm in heaven, Lt. Hey! Hey, I think it's coming from a different staircase. I got one! I got somebody! I got somebody! Is she... Is she alive Shit... Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right now. C'mon, Stephen. Goddamn it Stephen! I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did! My Lt. might have something to say about that. John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see... Never mind. This is your city job Have you guys got something against dalmatians Do you have to do that Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you What, you think he made that little gem up Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning. What's going on Thanks. Hey. interrupting With grenadine, right Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun Carrying Swayzak's notebook Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. What was that Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II. What What's going on Yeah. Big fan. Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman. No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin. Every little boy's fantasy. I have a job. Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions like dying young. Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. Politics don't. C'mon Jennifer, he's just another NorthSide jagoff with a mouth. So now you suddenly care about my future Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them. You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here... So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what C'mon, let's crawl home. This Having fun, fireman What, are you kidding By myself What, is it the stairs Christ, I'll let you win next time. No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me. Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me! Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team... I waited... I would have fucking waited... Dad's way Where did he tell you that In a fucking seance You're right, Stephen... You win... You're the best, man... I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it. Yeah... Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant. Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere. I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. Where are you going Hey, do I know you What the hell are you talking about my What do you want me to do with What are you listening to Glass Another backdraft. No it couldn't. I mean you'd be right  with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug  industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here  but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot. In another life I was in highend electronics. Don't mention it. Hey, Tim. So, you surviving without me Swayzak's not my boss. Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh I would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know... Yeah Where Thanks for the insight. Just leave me alone, okay Uh, I don't think that's in my contract... Trychtichlorate is a binary structured During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium. Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder. And the putty around the door But the right guess on this is arson. Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case. Arson. Hey. Boss and I are up to about three words an hour. I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here. Yeah Well, maybe I can fit it in... Call ya back. Jesus! What But he killed these guys. What reason That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience Are you going public with this Hey... So are you dating your boss or what Sorry. Are you dating anyone Well, you did invite me here. Nice boat. Okay. No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one. Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked. In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah. Thanks for the invite. Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies. This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think See that trap door up there That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman. I wanted to be a good one. Old firehouse trick. Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. This is a six inch playpipe, cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows. item This is our pipe extender, used in forward lays... This is our hard suction line... Our adjustable insertion nozzle... trunk ...And this is the hose bed. Excuse us. Is he... Do they think he'll pull through I should have been there. You had to do it, didn't you Had to take on another fire bare handed, huh Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened Is it, Stephen He didn't listen He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him. You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points. Yeah And just how much of all this has been doing your job Leave Stephen out of this I work for the city. Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight. I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot. Backdraft Fire. Somewhere between zero and no way. Go talk to the building owner. Our book lists the owner as Dekom Trust. together in his mind Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb. So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants... Nice bunch of guys. Hi. Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden. You could check. It'd be in his files. Yes. Your boss is lying, Jennifer. Jennifer What is I'm sorry. You're right. Yeah Airtight I've got three different drafts of the same report  with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along. Then who wrote the report How ya feeling Did you pull me out Did I say thanks Just wondering. So what do you want me to do I'm close... but I can't get who it is... Who's doing this Then who I don't have a story. What I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... The outlets. Trychticholorate. Who the fuck is doing this Who's doing this Oh Jesus Christ... Oh goddamn it Stephen... Just... Just wanted to say hello... You're selling dad's boat I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do. Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other It's okay, Stephen, I I saw it. When dad died, I saw another fire... I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... Sometimes right when you're looking at them. Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people! How do you know What were they doing there What are we going to do about this We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen. Oh, Christ. Stephen... Where are they Where's 17 Stephen Did you do it for Tim Just come down, John. Just He killed people Stephen, this is bullshit You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it Are you Stephen You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be Stephen! NO! You're gonna be all right, man. Hey! Over here! No... No more. Another time, friend. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't. Oh man, don't you die... Don't you die... Goddamn it don't you die now... Not now! Yeah. Like it never happened... See that glow flashing in the corner of your eye That's your career dissipation light. And it just went into high gear. I think your boss is going to need some spin control.

Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay. Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family. You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. Do yourself a favor and just walk away. That's Franny. She likes firemen. Gentlemen, please... As 17's official toastmaster Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to mention that you were cut out of my will I think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes  I mean probationary firemen  among us who today were baptized officially into the world of Old Man Fire. First to Tim, who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears, not only took on the beast but pulled from its clutches  assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter me  a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail. And to Brian, who's own contribution was both more beautiful and less likely to sue. Y'know, when I heard that both McCaffrey brothers were going to be assigned together here, well, my heart was filled with... a sudden desire to transfer. So raise a glass, lads. To funny looking Tim, and the McCaffrey brothers, who despite years of getting on each other's nerves have managed with great effort... to still be pissed off at each other. Gentlemen! Fuckin' city transferred Sally three months ago out of parking violations into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and she's stuck with an asshole. Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life Maybe you should have gotten more sleep last night. It's just new. Couple'a shifts and it'll be as thrashed as the rest. It's okay... This job... This fuckin' job sometimes... To buy it trying to go the extra yard, man, that's one thing, but to buy it just because there wasn't any backup... it's bullshit... Yeah... Biggest in two battalions. What the hell's the matter with you, huh You're steppin' in the shit again. You could've done it. You don't want this. Wake up, kid. Let's wait for a backup, Stephen. We're early on this one, it hasn't even broke out yet. We're one short as it is with Brian gone. It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one. Let me take the lead, Stephen... Oh God! Oh God no! He's alive. Aw man, Stephen, listen to me... They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department. That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early Why didn't you listen to me! You gotta let me finish Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department! You can't let him turn you against your friends, man You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out What he would do to your dad's department You gotta let me finish it ...What do you want me to do, Stephen Talk to me.

114,SHADOW,Backdraft,1991,False,"If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll start charging you admission. Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work I may have a stroke. They're gonna have to wait a few days on this one. Alderman Swayzak. I need to get in the trunk. Awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, Alderman. But then I guess you haven't been to too many fires. You'll have an answer as soon as I do. You mean his firehouse closing program,  Don't you Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wannabees, well, I guess I can't say I sleep any less peacefully. ...So stop me if I get this wrong... The fire's almost out... You're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat. You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash Hey, I'm a hero. Heroes don't just stand around. So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline You could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence I use to prove it's arson. You've made my day longer, Probie. Go home and think about that. Your Dennis' kid. I work alone. Are you still here Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way. Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first Pest control. How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal. He works for me. You like everybody, Ronald. You don't know him. Knock it off. Now. Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald When you got bored, what did you do You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it Nobody cares, Ronald. Sure Ronald You're ready alright. Excuse me. What do you do with little girls What do you do with them, Ronald Huh And old ladies And the world  the whole world. See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go. Hey kid, c'mere  At least make yourself useful. Turn this over. Shhh. You sneaky little son of a bitch... Hide and seek... Come on, tell me what I want to know... recorder Heavy smoke stains observed in entry room. Demarkation line high. Fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off. It started somewhere else... Less soot here. More heat. And very little soot here. Get that couch out of the way. So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. Find me some glass. Do we have a language barrier here Glass. Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh What made you that mad Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air... Finish coat burned away... Severe spawling of rough coat... That's our ignition point. Dig it out. Carefully. Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire. Have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants. Check the wall for burn patterns. Putty On both doors McCaffrey, hold this for us. I just rewrote your contract. C'mere... Trychticholorate Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago. What the hell was it doing in the fire I asked you to hold him, not feel him up... Read. Go to the bottom. Under heat properties. Ever burned magnesium It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM! Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  unless you could find something that would eat its residue. Look, it isn't proof, okay Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes. Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier I don't guess. I don't work for them, either. Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it off. That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh Our killer doesn't love fire! I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much.  The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason. Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out. No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point. No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away. Goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of chemical traces and a behavioral link. Oh, and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest any time. Get your stuff and get out. Alderman. I usually have breakfast first. Don No Marty, I don't. We still haven't found a connection between the victims. Holcomb I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet. Is there a connection between them, Alderman What the hell are you doing here I thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange... And he's right. The backdraft was set somewhere in there. It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door. But the outer door held... and waited for Tim... So find me the fire. You're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost. In a word, Brian, what is this job all about It's a living thing, Brian. It breathes, it eats, and it hates. The only way to beat it is to think like it. To know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to. Some guys on this job, fire owns them. It makes them fight on its level. But the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like Ronald. We're the fire department, lady. You work here You seem real broken up about Mr. Holcomb. I still haven't gotten your fire report, Stevie. On Tim. I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it. What happened up there He was a candidate. Did he pay attention Was he listening What do you listen to, Stephen I might. I need that report, Lt. Son of a bitch. They knew each other. And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either. Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared. We need to get a look at his files. This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight. Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job  Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box. It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk. Hello Swayzak Uh... I sorta got a problem here... Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now... Yeah. No. I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless... I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place... In the Chicago Fire Department the alarm code 335 signifies that the company has returned home to quarters. We will now ring out that code to welcome home John Adcox and Stephen McCaffrey... Your brother was a good man. Another couple of good men get burned up for their city Is that how it's going to read You're the only one that knows. Want to help me with something Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin' This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this This is just a guess of course, but I think they're gonna want to know why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to create a phony manpower study. You guys'll wait, right Brian. Don't keep looking over your shoulder for the ghost.

Is Detective Williams in I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. Alright. Yeah, I know. No. No thank you. Yeah. okay. Yeah. It was nice meeting you too. Yeah. Excuse me, Mrs. Williams. I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. It must be great. Mrs. Williams Thanks for the cake. Say goodnight to Sandy. Yeah, how did you know Oh yeah Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. No. You're not bothering me. You a senior How is Central these days What else is new. right I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. What do you know about the ear. anything Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything Do you know who was brought in for questioning Were all these people questioned this afternoon The ear is from a missing person maybe It's a strange world isn't it Do you know what building the woman lives in I guess you have to get back home soon Where are they Did they find out anything when they questioned her Oh yeah. What about those other people . Anything You really do hear a lot, don't you I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. I don't know. he moved away. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. I guess I'll see you sometime. Yeah. Good bye. Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying rigs later on Okidoke Ed. Thanks. You hungry or thirsty, or both I'd like to talk to you about something. I don't want to cause any trouble. I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few Awake magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright Let's go. Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner. That's a good sign. Pest control. gotta do your apartment. Nope. it's new stuff. no smell. That oughta do it. Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened Yes and no. Did you recognize him I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh Yeah. You go first. Pretty clever. Are you game for more You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that. I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. See ya! Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on Can I use the car tonight First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile.

It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the yellow man. you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. . Actually. I've been in twice. Yes. Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know. That doesn't bother you, does it and happy for it That's what I thought. Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world. Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl. I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirtyfive, okay Okay, Sandy. Can I give you a kiss good night Okay. okay. See ya tomorrow. Hello Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in even more trouble with Frank. I hope not. I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out more about Frank. Damn! Wow. Fifteen more minutes. You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll. What happened Oh yeah What about the woman Man oh brother. I'm really sorry. You want to go talk to him That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a welldressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. Yeah. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much. You worry about me really Hello.

I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. This is Frank Booth. His address is on the back of the photo. He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous. This photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank's apartment. And that man came out with a third man this welldressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. Williams everything . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

119,SANDY,Blue Velvet,1986,False,"Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you. Are you the one that found the ear. I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central. You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office Am I bothering you Yes. Terrible. boring. Yeah. What are you doing now That's too bad. Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others. No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts. Maybe so. Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. Not really, why You want to see the building. Come on, I'll show you. That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching. I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you. I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case. My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home Still, it must be kinda rough. What happened to him I've gotta go in. I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. I don't know. Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute. Please, don't say anything to Mike. promise I'm here, aren't I Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. Alright, now tell me. What is it You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. is beginning to like Jeffrey It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. Now, how are you going to do that What will I say when she comes to the door I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous. You've got a point there. Alright. Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. Alright. Good luck, yourself. Are you alright I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. Yeah, if it opens the door. So. what's next I owe you. since I goofed up this one. Yes. I do. You really want to do this, don't you her better judgment I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do I already know. The Slow Club. It's on Route 7. Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. What's the plan. Brilliant. This is not my usual Friday night! SLEAZY MAITRE D' Good evening. two That sounds good. That guy was filled with information. I'll drink to that. M.C. Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady. Miss Dorothy Vallens. Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you. Yeah. but. O.K. . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. Okay. yeah, call. Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep I'm going to wait here until she comes. I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up.

I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. this before proceeding . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble. So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

You and Em were tight for a bit. Who's she eating with now Eating with. Lunch.           Who. You gonna tell me Where's Emily God. I know you do, so why don't you want me to find her Well I appreciate that. Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, I'm a friend from school. Could I speak to... I'm calling for details. Details about the party. I don't think we've met. I can imagine. her off You should really work on your invite management. That might be a personal 'room for improvement' area in your life. But discretion of your invite sending aside, I have procured a certain someone's invitation, and would like details. 11 Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora and spats. You don't know me  I'll save you some time. Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation I've got. Emily Kostich. Tom! Could you step aside, please I'm trying to follow Brad's story, and it's difficult when I can't see his face. 14 Leaving. Uh huh. Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd act. That's what I was doing. Jameson. That's a pretty sick thing to be attracted to. Uh huh. Uh huh. 17 Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. I just want to find her. Coffee and pie oh my Sure. Yes. 18 19 Where's Dode Dode Kara told me you know where Em's at. She asked for my help. It's not about that. Where is she You're on the bright side of dim, Dode, but if I thought you had this half handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's she at Throw one at me if you want, hash head. I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you. Where's Em Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but I want to hear it straight from her. Today. She knows where I eat lunch. 22 Who fed you that line, Em The Carrows rat 24 So what am I You've got to come back to me, Em. You're in a spot, I can get you out of it. Come back to me, and whatever heat follows you I'll deal with. Tell me about the trouble, the brick and the pin Mm. Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear them without being seen, and that would only biff their play. Best to know it's there, let it ride and see what comes of it. But anyway. Yeah. But Dode wouldn't know it Call anything up 27 Yeah. I couldn't sleep. Yeah. What, are you here for zero Bad break. She's gone. No, I can't. Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I don't know. Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to but I can't. I don't think I can. No. Yeah. I think I could. Kara tried to rope me. She came right out and asked. She was scared. Tell me to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to drop it. Yes I am. I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr, there's not much chance we'll come out clean. Twenty four seven on this one. You okay to op for me again 32 The Brain barely smiles. No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash their dusty standards at the wideeyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this I want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit. I don't know. Your mom still have the cell Borrow it for a few days, get me the number. Wait for my word, and cover for me first period. I'm going to be a little late. EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD  DAY A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull runner. This wasn't a business sit. But yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight, partnered up and sent him over. PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier, more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He keeps talking directly at us. I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again. Jerr and whoever's next. I want to keep you safe. An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement. Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground. A beat.     Gulls cry in the distance. Keep it on vibrate. Better stop meeting me in the open too. I'm going to start getting visible, and I need you on the underneath. I'll call. I bet. Keep him off me  stonewall him, he won't bite, just keep him away from me. Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to throw a few words at you, tell me if they catch. Brick. Or bad brick. Tug. Drink Poor Frisco. Pin. The Pin, yeah. I've heard it. Jake1 runner, right You think the Pin's just a tale to take whatever heat A show of hands. No. Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard that helps. In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to Dope runner' in post 37 Isn't this Dode's brand Oh I do now. I'm going to start shaking things up. Give me the story and you might miss the bite. Alright. I don't want to play games if you've got a headache. Get me if you want to spill it, but I can't guarantee safe passage after tonight. Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card, and I need words. Tail Kara through lunch. She's got rehearsal but she'll blow early. She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call. Listening. Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the Gophers. Of all things, yeah. Been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. You've got heart, kid. How soon can you move to Minneapolis Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system. Yeah. There's a thesaurus in the library. 'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait. To the parking lot Well gee I kind of invited myself. No, I'm having too good a time. With you movies Sure. Yeah. Uh huh. 42 Home. Same reason I'm taking one now. I'll get where I'm going just fine. Go away. Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and I'm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so I'm better off coming at it clean. I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. With you behind me I'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and I can't spare it. 43 No, I'm not. Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't she Get the numbers S'alright. Are me and Brad front page news Yeah. Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though. 44 Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang Keep him off. And keep your specs on  I need to find that kid. No sir, never seen him. Like I said, he asked for my lunch money first. Good thing I brown bagged it. No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed. Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk. Tough but fair. Uh huh. 46 I was done here three months ago. I told you then I'd give you Jerr and that was that, I'm not your inside line and I'm not your boy. You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here No. And no more of these informal chats if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the parent conference. Maybe. Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back completely for a few weeks. There might be some heat soon. 47 If I get caught like that it's curtains anyway  I couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public. I'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts. Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask. I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who knows where. I shook but she's not spilling. And I know enough about Kara to let that worry me. Alright, keep your specs on for him. Any other news She did, huh She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me. That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode, tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll call you tonight. 49 I want to see the Pin. You the Pin Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you. Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first she oughta hear this. I was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal, anything so you'd let me walk. Then I was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh. 1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox. Where are my glasses Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door in Water's fine, ma'am, thanks. Apple juice sounds terrific. That's perfect. I don't know. It starts out same as before, and this floor ain't carpeted. Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head. I want him out. The ape blows or I clam. 56 About a year ago I had a small time dealing partnership with Jerr Madison. Know him Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player. I got out clean almost. Nothing on my official record, but the VPs play it like I owe them one. When I made it clear I wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it. They keep calling me in, badgering me. I don't like being told whose side I'm on. So now they think I'm on your trail, I'm in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours. You haven't got me yet. Considering the benefits my services could yield, I don't think that's unreasonable. Whatever serves your interests. Just drop me at school. How long was I out Thanks. They drive on in silence. EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT  DUSK Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully. He studies her face for a moment. Less than when I didn't trust you before. If you can tell me your angle in this, maybe I can. So far. You think Em scraped the junk off the Pin Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene shot as written is on the 59 This all helps but it's not what I asked. What's your angle in all this Now you are dangerous. Where's Dode flopped I know you two are cozed up, so you'll tell me or you won't. It worked. You went to Laura, didn't you Told her my tale. Turned out to be. Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I just hate myself. Where's Dode flopped I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily. It's important. Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be. No Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the 61 sense to get out from under you before he gets hurt. Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless his crew spotted VP Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us 7030. If we're in I get under his skin and see what's what. You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura. I'll let you know when she is. You the Pin's So what's his answer 63 Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a sheepdog. The Pin. If he's with the Pin everything's kablooie and I gotta blow the burgh. Never mind. If I don't call by three call in the bulls. So Yeah. South of T Street, yeah. So Are you making an offer Hire another hash head to blade me Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post 66 What do you want Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the Burns lug, but the main thing is to find Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked into, it's getting more and more urgent we talk. Trueman and the VP Asked for me That's not good. Alright, keep me posted. 67 Small fries. Oh yeah What was it What was it Almost, you said. Yeah Muscle you can't control's no good at that. Alright. What Yeah. Oh yeah 69 What Agh. Probably. I got home late. OD Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that form of Heroin be called 'Brick' I told you to stay clear of Laura. I gotta get voicemail. No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at one. Any luck with the lug This isn't good. 71 Mr. Trueman please. What the hell are you doing asking for me in class What I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here. We shouldn't have met in the open. Alright, lay low, but ask on the underneath for Dode. That's all that matters now, find Dode, but do it on the underneath, got it I'd like to have played it safe, but there's no time. The Pin's not letting 72 anything drop, so I gotta push things a bit. I don't know. Just find Dode. 73 Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at school, the VP's so hot for me. I'm looking to find this big game the Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so when its tail jams in my back I'll know who to bill for the embalming. I did. He didn't tell me. 74 When a gee I'm paid to side with won't give me the straight that makes me nervous. Makes me angry. Huh. Didn't tell you. What about the ninth brick Yeah Frisco. I heard something fell with Emily Kostich. Kostich. Huh. Not to me. Sure. 76 Just shooting the shat. A while back. Yeah, I heard that. What has Emily got to do with you That's my ride. A payphone, anywhere. What time is it What time What time is it Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Okay, you've got to, what you've got to do is drive around to the Carrows lot. 79 I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the basketball field. So you've got to go by you or me to get down there. If you see anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their crew go down into the ravine, honk four times, long short long short. But don't be seen. Do it! Will you do it I need you to do this. I need you, here. Please. What are you doing, Dode What do you think you're doing, Dode What'd you see What'd you see me 80 Yeah, I did. That's all you saw What about before Did you see who killed her before I got there I found the body, Dode. Who's 'we' I didn't kill her, Dode. Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I know you tried to help her so I'm telling you now you're in over your head, you don't want to put your hand in this Why was she scared, Dode She came to me, who was she scared of I think I know why, I just gotta know who! Dode. What was yours What was yours What'd I miss Oh yeah That so, Dode 83 So walk. What's the info have to do with you anyways Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail. He's a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood. Why pay for dirt you can't believe Maybe you will. Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't trust it. I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let him milk you if you want. So maybe you should. Tug, it's alright! What's the stats 86 Tide War The hell I am. Alright, I'm with you. Hey. 87 Yeah. I was there. Where were you yesterday I called. Alright, listen Just listen. Is my name in the papers with the story Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers Listen, I'm going to be calling you tonight, probably late. Sleep with your phone on. Could you get a car if you needed to Be ready then. I'll call. You scheming tramp. You set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale. You got info from Laura and held Dode like a card till you could play him. For money! You'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money. You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy. Showing your ace. Brendan storms out. Also on the DVD. Fine retailers everywhere. 90 Laura here So what are the stats Tug got hot. He panicked. No. He's been anxious cause he thought if you found out he killed Emily you'd turn him over. Yeah, well. Alright. So he's a hot head. So you don't want him on your side, at least let's have a pow wow fore we start digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies. What would it take Alright, but we can talk. Four o'clock. Tonight. Let's clear it all before it boils up again. Yeah. I don't know. She was at the Pin's. Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock tonight, his place. Take all the muscle you want, you won't need it. He wants to talk straight, and you're going to work with him for whatever he needs, cause you don't want war. The Pin's sitting on the brick profits hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance. Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing. War'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh. Yeah. Go away. I've got to make sure it plays out smooth. I've got to make sure. Cause if there's war, I'm in it too. Alright, stop. Tell your boys no knuckle business. Your folks left a car here Take it and Laura's. I'll go first in yours. I'll take the scenic route to draw off any tailers. They'll think it's you, they might even radio back that you're alone. Get it Alright. Got a cigarette I've seen you smoke. 96 Give me fifteen minutes, then go. Alright, I warned you. Can you get the car Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her. Alright Alright I'll call you when it gets light. Thanks, Brain. 97 Talk. That's square. You did them after all. Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake on that. Good. Let's seal it up and blow for keeps. It's yours. Why would it be Did you, Tug Alright, so let's shake and blow. What would be good enough I'll dose it. If it'll shut you two apes up I'll   take the dose, and if I don't die we're   all right as rain, and if I do die you   two have your war, so long as you keep   it off my grave. Deal Johnny, go with him. 100 No! No, that's not Pin, think about it Hey. Where are you Did she blow last night You didn't give her a ride, did you But she came straight to school from Tug's She there now Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep. No. I took your advice and didn't go. What happened Yeah Huh. Yeah. Probably. Yeah I did. No. No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me. I set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun. That was you, angel. It was you. What, you want the whole tale You want me to tell it to you Alright, from the top. You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who you were hooked with. Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. She goes on the backburner. Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma. So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. You know trouble. There's going to be a war over this. And there's Emily. She trusts you. She wants in. It's duck soup. You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. Last week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was scared of. Tug's car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was across the street, angel. She saw the passenger side. She saw you. She saw you and ran like she saw some devil. 107 And she took the hit. Dode hid her away, but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. Gave her a time, and a place. And sent Tug. Just to get the straight. But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing  he hit her. She took the hit for you. You let her take it. That's the tale. You're going to tell me it's not Look at me. I hope it isn't. I want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug. But I think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. I think that was your final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman's office this morning is wrong. About your and Brad's involvement in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't steal the brick last night. In your purse. That's good. That means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. You didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing. It's done. 109 You get your straight S'alright. Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep. She called me a dirty word. As whatall. Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence.

124,EMILY,Brick,2005,False,"Yeah. How's things Yeah That's good. It's good to see you, Brendan. It's been some time. Yeah. I didn't even know your locker. I had to ask Brain. I can't. 3 I screwed up real bad. I really screwed up. incoherent I did what she said with the brick, I didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on it now for poor Frisco and they're playing it all on me You gotta help me Brendan I think tug Oh! With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out of the booth. There, another pay phone up the hill  empty. Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side window.1 The mustang turns the corner, gone. Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the street. Still smoking. A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter. In the distance the class bell rings. EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY  DAY The high school is open air  the hallways are alleyways between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the 4 I must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone. Yesterday. It was dumb, I got paranoid over a really stupid thing. I was high, I went crazy for a little bit, but now you have to forget about it. Please. That's how you can help me now, forget about it. Brendan, I know you're mad at all these people, cause you think I went away from you and went to them. But you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where I want to be at's different from where you wanna be at. And stop picking on Dode. He's a good guy. He's a good friend. Yeah, what are you Eating back here, not liking anybody, how are you judging anyone I loved you alot but I couldn't stand it, I had to get with people. I couldn't heckle life with you, I had to see what was what. I'm sorry Brendan. No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do that, I'm not like you. No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't want to be put away and protected. No. No. You gonna fix things like you did with Jerr No. I came to say goodbye, for good. Whatever you have to do to let me go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've 25 decided that. Make sure that, you've got to, promise you won't torture yourself, that you'll let me go. She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket. His face is a frozen mask. Let me go. As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from her jacket pocket. He watches her as she walks away. You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in a bigger world now, and you can't hide me from it, and you can't beat it. Not if I don't want you to. Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong.

125,THE BRAIN,Brick,2005,False,"Hey Brendan. It's been awhile. Where you been eating Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it been, a couple months A few days ago. Was I wrong To give it It's been so long, I don't know you two's stats. I dunno. It's hard to keep track. Can be. 5 She hasn't been doing too good. Help with what Well. I know she was poking in with the Ivybound cheerleading elite. Laura Dannon's crowd. Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on the upper crust. Know him I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged after them for a bit, but it didn't work. So she picked her way down the food chain. Last I seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp. Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated That's my bus. Kara's 239. Sure. 7 Hm. Do you know anything else about this Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us 26 Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly when he came back to whosehername, at the theater Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is, it didn't come straight from Dode, less he's playing out of his league. I can only give you my best guess. When the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town. I know under the pier's one, down by the bike trails in the state park's another. There's alot of them. The pitch is they've got little symbols for each one, and that's how they tell each other the place, so word won't get around. So this might be that. This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan grease. How many places start with 'A' Or if it's a shape, or just a random symbol. Anyway, even if you figured it out, what good could you do She's smart, she knows the play, she's gunning to square things. You said her business was none of yours, so she's alright, forget it now. Go home, sleep. Hey, Brendan. You're up early. Find Emily You alright Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause the others don't run by my street. Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the word with Em Can't raise her So what now 31 You think you can help her You think you can get the straight, maybe break some deserving teeth Well. Walk from it. Drop it. You're thick as whatall, Brendan. What first, tip the bulls Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go. So what first In her car. There's the cell number. Yeah. Trueman asked for you. Wants words in his office. I'll try. So what's first No. A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure 35 No. Tug... that might be a drink. Vodka and milk or something, or maybe not. Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore last year, I think. Real trash, maybe hit a class a week. Didn't know him then, and haven't seen him around. Pin... the Pin The Pin's kind of a local spook story. You know the Kingpin Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26, lives in town. All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who 36 Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang they'll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list'll always end with the Pin. But I'll becha you got every rat in town together and said 'show your hands' if any of them've actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets. But what's first You didn't call. Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill. No. Sorry. All the buzz. You really do that Why Is Brad the Pin I told you before I don't know the car. Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody I know that you don't. And Trueman again Okay. FADE OUT. FADE IN 45 No, Dode's MIA all around. 48 No more job offers So she's got a play. Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking for you. Fourth period, nearly shook me upside down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If I had known where you were I might have told her. So what happens now I think she's with us, Brendan. Okay. 62 Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to any crowd. He's definitely not muscle for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd but doesn't hang with them. If you've got a guess I could check it out I'll check it. I'm in third now 64 Brendan You alright Alright. Trueman was looking for you. No, just Trueman. No, but looked. Don't go to class. Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in asking for you. Did they call your mom Get out of there too, then. Meet me behind the library. I've got some stuff. Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks ago. He was in a coma, his stomach contained a sausage sandwich, a horse dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in laundry detergent. Frisco's still under 70 and nobody's talking, so nothing's come of it. No, the chem the junk must have been cut with put him down. No  it was a concentrated powder, its street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or 'brock'. pocket Here. From Laura. You tell her to stay clear of me No. What What are you going to do How Brendan Are you  what, man, have you heard about Dode You Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I just now got it back. Are you okay No. Yeah. What do you mean 88 If it's late enough I could take my mom's Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Library. Where are you No. Stayed there till six thirty, then walked to school.

127,LAURA,Brick,2005,True,"Whiskey 15 I like a man who knows what he's drinking. Brad's not a good guy to get on the wrong side of. Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix me one. I'll never get through all this. I knew your old partner Jerr since grade school. Tough break. How long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting 16 Keep up with me now. I don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious. Now I'm not so sure. Coffee and pie. And you didn't hear it from me. Will you wait here for me You'll stay right here and wait  I'll be five minutes. Hey. You're quite a pill. Where are you going Why did you take a powder the other night Hold it. I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to be giving a girl who's where you want to know about. I want to help you. I wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand You're not Brad. Tug, stop. I'll drive you back. Half an hour. It took all of it for me to cool the Pin down. 58 You trust me now Come here.1 Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers. I'm on the in, top level of the tower and I know everyone, but I don't know all what goes on. I knew Em when she tried to get with me and Brad, and I liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't us, and it didn't work. When she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the Pin to keep them going. With me A few months go by, and the next I hear the Pin's raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to, and the downfall's coming on Em's head. I don't know, but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it must have been grand. I've never seen the Pin so hot. I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp, but... maybe I see what you're doing for Emily, trying to help her. And I don't know anyone who would do that for me. What Lie down, Brendan You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or Three forty. You've got to rest, you're feverish. Get back in the car, I'm taking you home, you're sick, you need Get back in the car. Wait! I'll drive you back. What's going to happen 92 Do you feel better Tug. He's right, Tug. Smooth it out. 93 You going I'm sorry Brendan. 94 Don't go tonight. It'll play however it plays without you there. Why Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car. I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care. Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not What, school C'mon. Family I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears. 95 Did you see it all With Tug and the Pin No The papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug. Tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there. They tied him to Dode, too. Same gun. And the girl. Well good thing you weren't there. 105 You think the girl was Emily You loved her. You did all this cause you loved her. And now it's finished. I love you. What What are you talking about 106 Tell it to me. No. Brendan, why are you Stop it! Stop it! It's not! You know me. I've only helped you. How can you  It isn't true! No 108 I didn't. Brendan... don't... Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of 10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his. Told her it would soften him up. She said she wished she could keep it, but she didn't love the father. I was going to drive her down the next day, we'd found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was starting to show. 3 months.

130,PIN,Brick,2005,False,"Yeah. So now I'm very very curious what you're going to say next. Helled if you're gonna go breaking my best clients' noses and expect me to play sandbag. Anyway you've been sniffing me out before then, sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse 52 with a nick on its ear he can suck on. They do that. So now you got Tugger to bring you here, which he never does, and you got me listening, so I'm curious what you've got to say that better be really, really good. No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat trick, though. No good, soldier. 53 Alright, let up. Sorry about this kid, but what the hell with what you said before. 54 Where you were at, with all of us and the Tug a fist away, you've got to use your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah, you're not scared of me, I got it, but I'm also thinking you're a little nuts now, so you've got that trade off with your standing. But nuts isn't all bad, so maybe it was a good play. I don't know. So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you upstairs, back with the living. Thanks, mom. So hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale We're cooled off. Looky, soldier Give us a few minutes, Tug. I'll call you if whatever. So Till he took the fall for you. Gee that's tough. I gotcha. 57 What, price And what are your services exactly, just so I can be specific on the invoice Fair enough. I'll have my boys check your tale, and seeing how it stretches we'll either rub or hire you. You'll know which by end of the day tomorrow. We're done. So. Tangles. That's what you'll get every week for your services. Less of course there's a specific job involved, in where you get sliced in with my crew. Square We're doing a thing down at the Hole tonight. Know it 65 It's sort of a welcome you in thing. Eight o'clock. The car stops. EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE  DAY Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch. So I'm going to start you on the dope circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues, pulling in the strags. Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle. Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm tailing out this big deal, but that's almost done. Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there was a snag in it, but it's almost done now. It's over. It's over enough. You're gonna make me curious, being so curious. They sit in the sand, facing the breakers. I gotta lay something out. You're coming into a certain situation, and I'm bringing you in sort of because of it. If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and 68 I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I decided I oughta hear what you were gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug just did it, though. He was hot, and he just hit you. He's been doing that. He's got my best interests, I know, he's loyal, he just gets hot. You're working for me, not Tug, that's all. Things can get, you know, it's tough sometimes. Twisted, complicated, watching all the, I don't know. Everyone's got their thing. You read Tolkien Tolkien, the Hobbit books His descriptions of things are really good. He makes you want to be there. Pow wowing Good. You alright, soldier So, Tug, I got a call. Someone who says they know something about Emily. Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says we'd want to know. Wants to meet. So we'll meet him. Four o'clock. Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You know Emily, didn't you You've heard she's missing So maybe you want to come along too. 77 Show, maybe we'll find out. Four o'clock. Four o'clock. Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead. Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He says he knows where the body's at. And he says he wants more money than I think the information's worth. Plenty, he says. Stay. It's still too much. I know my business. It's still too much. Tug, stop. 85 Tug... Everyone's paying social calls. So The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies. And if you're with him, you're with him. Tug's been after my digs from the get go. He was right. I told him to get the straight, no roughing. I wasn't even there. 91 I don't know. We'd have to square everything between us. He owes me some money. Yeah, alright. Tomorrow Four tonight. You'll be here I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don't even want my name pulled in the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time. Third thing. The last brick. That aint the point. I'm gonna start selling it. How do I know it aint bad Why was the last one Cause someone got greedy. Tug here's had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time. Now we're splits my loss of trust's retroactive. Not good enough. I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove it. Then we're square. I wanna see it. Your not wanting to dose it's telling me something right here. What Fine.   Tangles.

131,REGGIE,Charade,1963,False,"Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded. Sylvie! Isn't there something constructive he can do  like start an avalanche Sylvie  I'm getting a divorce. He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have but I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable. Because I don't love him. I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial, but that doesn't mean I'm ready for French Traditional. I loathe the idea of divorce, Sylvie, but  if only Charles had been honest with me that's all I ask of anybody  the simple truth. But with him, everything is secrecy and lies. He's hiding something  something frightening something terrible  and evil. It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank Why, do you think we're going to I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else. Quitter. You give up awfully easy, don't you I'm afraid you're blocking my view. The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have  I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name I'm Regina Lampert. Yes. No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce. No, you see, I don't really love him. Yes, I am  I'm compulsive about it dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore. Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste  the small size  and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size that the large size is the smallest size there is. Is there a Mrs. Joshua That wasn't a proposal  I was just curious. Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms  now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you  Pete Now you're angry. Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again How do you know Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me Charles is. Lord, I hope so. Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks. house Don't you want me to stay you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay Merci. Honorine  ! Charles  ! Yes. I'm very cold. Leave I'm very confused. Swiss. He didn't have one. I don't know. I suppose so. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I know. I'm sorry. I wish you wouldn't. I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody. A letter May I see it My dear Regina I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed. Not very much, is it Did you Is that all Can I go now Of course it is. I don't understand. It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now. What are you doing here How did you find out Thank you. Yes it is  I heard it this morning. They must have turned off the electricity. Charles sold it all  at auction. Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose. I'm a simultaneous translator like Sylvie, only she's English to French  I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him. Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this  tossed off a train like a sack of thirdclass mail. I don't know where to go. Not too expensive  I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. I loved this room  but Charles never saw it  only what was in it. All those exquisite things I think I prefer it like this. It's not exactly what I'd call a large turnout. Don't ask me  I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him. Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name  now it turns out I didn't even know that. I've never seen him before. How can you tell Yes I don't understa Merci, Monsieur. The American Embassy. I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter. Hello Hello Uh  Miss Tompkins isn't here. Mrs. Lampert  Mrs. Charles Lampert.

If I can just  yes, I'm getting it  a case of some sort  it's heavy. If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy. No. No, JeanLouis. It's nothing, I tell you! Where is he It's done in America all the time. Who do you think did it  Gideon Or Tex You're a big help. Can I have one of those Vanillechocolat. I think Tex did it. Because I really suspect Gideon and it is always the person you don't suspect. What's so illogical about that Oh. I guess they just can't help it. Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that No  Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' without a care in the world This is good, want some I'm sorry. Alex I'm scared. No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed. What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three He wants it all, Alex  that means we're in his way, too. First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie  we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that No swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love  like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' Hurry up and change  I'm starved. It's the house detective  why haven't you got a girl in there Wouldn't it be better if you did it in my room I wouldn't want to use that tub. Besides, I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid. Got you. The shower's in there. This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower. I dare you. far What are you doing Shut the door! What on earth are you doing How often do you go through this little ritual I don't believe it. Yes Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew  I'm listening. Are you sure there's no mistake Do you mind if we go someplace crowded I  I feel like lots of people tonight. I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie  and the one who's going to be next  me How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is I've got that right, haven't I You don't know who did it. But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so It's a start, anyway. Carson Dyle didn't have a brother. I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings. Fiction or nonfiction Well! Go on. I suppose all this is leading somewhere What do you mean You mean, you're a thief I don't believe it. But I do believe it  that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle  Welcome home Peter Joshua. Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days I don't even know who I'm talking to any more. No  he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got  brains, charm, education, a handsome face there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is. Is there a Mrs. Canfield I could eat a horse. Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on All that marvelous rejection  you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money. Oh! No  I guess not. What What about it I'm not hungry  isn't it glorious Adam! You don't look so bad in this light. I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out. Oh Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day Aren't you allowed to kiss back Well  come on. I know why you're not taken  no one can catch up with you. I was, too. No  in my room. You're going to look for him  now Adam What is it Why I've looked, Adam  you know I have Lord, you're stubborn. But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it. Lord, you're stubborn. To the apartment  it matches mine perfectly. I'll bet you don't really need those. You need them. The tooth powder. Wait a minute could you recognize heroin just by tasting it Well, I guess that's it  dead end. I love you, Adam. No  last time I said I love you, Alex. I hope JeanLouis understands about last night  it's just not safe for him to be around me right now. Hold it  Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain. No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it  at least, nothing that the police thought was very important. Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had  on the day he was killed. I think it only said where  but I can't That money's not ours, Adam  if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law. Of course there is! Well  it was a place  a street corner, I think. But I don't through her earpiece Hold it. I'm on.

134,BARTHOLOMEW,Charade,1963,True,"I'm sorry  my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late. Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert it's a stubborn little devil. Drycleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man  an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building  to ease the gold outflow. Charles Lampert's widow  yes tie Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back. Voila! As they say. Have some, please. I've got... ...liverwurst  liverwurst  chicken and  liverwurst. Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert Central Intelligence Agency  C.I.A. Only we call them agents. Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert I'm an administrator  a desk jockey trying to run a bureau of overworked men with underallocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs Yes  That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business. Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government. To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency. Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name. Voss  Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss his desk I'd like you to look at this photograph, please  by the way, you saw this one, didn't you on the desk Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr. Aren't they  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and Yes  and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look. her Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. You're Charles Voss's wife  now that he's dead you're their only lead. Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert it's your only chance. Oh, haven't I The money  Mrs. Lampert  the money. The 250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too  they want it very badly. Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that! Oh, dear. Ours. And I'm afraid we want it back. That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it. I believe you. Oh, you've got the money all right you just don't know you've got it. Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert  you've got it. Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim  you look for it, Mrs. Lampert  I'm quite sure you'll find it. Look for it, Mrs. Lampert  look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear Here's where you're to call me day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert  and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself. We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes. Because they're still here. Like I said, Mrs Lampert  I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles. I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband. Where are you now  can you meet me Do you know Les Halles Incredible, isn't it Zola called it 'le ventre de Paris'  the womb of Paris, the belly. crate Were you followed Agents. Who What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert Describe him. No. That's not Carson Dyle. There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert  that's Carson. It's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead. I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. the military espionage unit  were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering 250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men Cafe. Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here. Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money. By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways  a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked. Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried  then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand  and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach. What's wrong with that one Have you any idea what these things cost over here Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again. We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together  but we still have no proof. C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back. I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away  no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you. That's the spirit. We're anxious to know who this man is  the one calling himself Dyle. No, Mrs. Lampert. No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington. I don't know  but I think you'd better find out, don't you You're in an ideal position  he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies. Mrs. Lampert  Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert I told them what you said  about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me  you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert  they told me Carson Dyle has no brother. None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert be careful. Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert  you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam Calm down, Mrs. Lampert  please. Does he have the money The envelope  imagine that.

135,ADAM,Charade,1963,False,"Oh, come on! It's simple. I like what I do  I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time. Yes, but Right. Now go eat your dinner. food I think that's what you ordered. How was I leading you on That's right. What would you like me to say that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars It's a tossup, I can tell you that. Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you Oh, you should see your face. nicely It's lovely. What's the matter It's all right  look. Why do you think I brought you here Pretty good, huh I taught them everything they do. How do you think I got here No. The doctor said it would be bad for my  thermostat. When you come on, you really come on. Relax  you're gaining. I don't know. In my room, asleep. That wraps it up  Tex has the money. Go back to bed  I'll let you know when I've found him. If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they There's no time  I'll call you in the morning. Yes Where are you, ol' buddy Open up. I think we were wrong about Tex having the money. I just heard from him  he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him  so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it. Where's that airlines bag I sure am. Get it. Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it. Let's look anyway. I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now. Electric razor  comb  steamship ticket  fountain pen  four passports  toothbrush  wallet wallet, finds nothing key  what about that The letter It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything Heroin  peppermintflavored heroin. Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight. Yes, you told me. Reggie  I think I've found are you on Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together. You didn't look. Last night, when we went through the airlines bag, something was missing. See One agenda. It wasn't there. Can you remember anything at all With whom Where Think, Reggie, you've got to think it may be what we're looking for. Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money. There is Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie  please think what was written in Charles' notebook It's Thursday today  and it's almost five  come on! Five o'clock  Thursday  the Garden it's got to be something around here. I know, but this is all we've got left. Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there. It's all right  I don't think Tex does, either. Look. I'd better see what he's up to. Stay here  I won't be long. The letter. Taxi!  Taxi! All right  where's the letter You know what I mean  the envelope with the stamps. I want it. What are you talking about Reggie  the stamps  what've you done with Where are you going Wait! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie  stop! I'm not Dyle  you know that! Don't be an idiot! Reggie  ! I want those stamps! I don't want to go anywhere  I'm only trying What But that's what they gave me. Reggie  ! Reggie  wait! Reggie  why won't you listen But I didn't kill anybody. Reggie  please believe me! Reggie  stop! That's Carson Dyle! It's Carson Dyle, I tell you! BARTHOLOMEW You're not going to believe him, Mrs. Lampert  it's too fantastic. He's trying to trick you again. Tex recognized him  that's why he said Dyle. If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too! BARTHOLOMEW Mrs. Lampert  if I'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps  he knows he'd never make it. BARTHOLOMEW What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lampert Are you going to believe every lie he tells you He wants the money for himself  that's all he's ever wanted. Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle! BARTHOLOMEW That's right, Mrs. Lampert  I'm a dead man  look at me. Reggie  listen to me! Reggie  trust me once more please. There's not a reason on earth why you should. It won't get you the stamps, Dyle You'll have to come out to get them, and I'm not likely to miss at this range. BARTHOLOMEW Maybe not  but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach  they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten months in a German camp  with nothing to stop the pain and no food they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. They deserved to die! Reggie  you'd better tell him. He wouldn't dare hit a girl. Here, give it to me. And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide. What a terrible thing to say.

137,HELEN,Copycat,1995,False,"Our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible.  They are hard to catch.  They are the nice guy next door, their employers  if they work at all  find them quiet and uncomplaining.  Early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity.  Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive.  What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity.  For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being.  Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain.  And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. Like addicts seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy  they seek out their next victim. The cycle is endless until they are caught.  And they are caught by chance  they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk.  A leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death. At any time, right now, as you listen, the FBI estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims.  The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science. Florida spent eight million dollars to execute Ted Bundy.  It would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research. Confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society.  Thank you. Andy!  Andy! It is October twelfth, 1994 in the city of San Francisco, California, U.S.A., the strongest, richest, most stable and happiest country in the world.  That is the sole place of life in the universe.  Under God. Good God.  What happened to you 'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your life.' 'Maybe it's better to just dream on avoid the disappointments of life.  Come on, move.' feel Yes You sonofabitch!  Son of a bitch... You filthy ... son of a bitch ! Damn fools! Who is this M.J. Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here. What is wrong with you people The first two, I thought he might be on a lunar cycle because they were 28 days apart, but obviously not.  This new one is only two weeks. You want to joke about moonbikes! M.J. No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help. You're calling me a crank M.J. Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am  Do you know any of the victims... I think this is number three... M.J. That's an opinion, not evidence... M.J. Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back here Where were you  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh... I got it myself... I couldn't wait. I've told you  I can't afford to garage it. I had the dream again. And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said You and me, you and me. He whispered, but it was him Andy  When a threeyearold says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad. I'm three years old.  Call the prison. Oh God.  I'm really crazy. Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure Andy You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look. But earlier, he was staring up here. Please , Andy. I'm calling the police! M.J. Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog. Is he out M.J. Who If he's not out, why are they here M.J. Because of your phone calls. What calls  I haven't made any calls. You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank Oh God, I am ! Make them some coffee. Halloran, is it  Investigator Goetz  I had a crank call myself he said... fear I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison. You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for M.J. You us , Doctor Hudson. Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way. M.J. Sugar and cream for Goetz I take mine black. You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love. Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then. M.J. Would you want to work with us on this Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent. M.J. I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours. Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown. M.J. Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good. Will you go.  Andy, make them go. M.J. You can't go out lecturing  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out I don't want this.  What are they Yes.  Without question. The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects. He was lying. I thought he was lying. Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear. He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time. The same as the first time... The first two murders. He told me he had done two others just like it. When he was seventeen. Yes.  I believed him. Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible. I want to die. Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me... About what I can't, Andy. The way he's posed the bodies... he's flaunting his power to do whatever he wants to her.  This man... He probably seems perfectly normal.  These murders are organized and planned. Except for this one.  You put that one in to test me. Is it an ongoing case M.J. For months... last October. It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her. M.J. How do you know that He felt remorse.  He covered her. The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize his I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding M.J. Nothing. Where are the stockings he strangled them with M.J. How did you know they were stockings I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake  it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bowknot. Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard. In the sixties.  He's dead stabbed to death in prison. M.J. Why imitate a dead serial killer If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this he's not done  he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me. M.J. Work with me. None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them. Get out!  All of you! Andy!  Please.  Don't you That's the face of the next one he'll kill. M.J. How do you know that Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left  Click on that... twice. M.J. How did you do that That computer's wired into INTERNET. He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen. M.J. Can you make a copy we can show on our computers It's too big a file to copy to a disk. It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz  Son of Sam  hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching you , laughing at you. One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone. M.J. He It's gone.  The file's not here. What did you do He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant. M.J. We'll show that to... Show what  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone... Do you remember what you saw I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out. M.J. I don't look at pictures.  I look at the real thing .  I don't feel infected. Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I know the redheaded woman in my computer. M.J. I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen. M.J. cont'd A forgery of the Mary Sullivan murder scene, he's done it perfect. Except for the sign. She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight M.J. Look at the sign.  'Hell'  In the Festival of Love  You make any sense in that M.J. cont'd For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's talking to you. It's anybody ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're fans .  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught. M.J. Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in your Because I'm his damned pinup girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this. Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out. I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened  Did he just stop  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more Did he kill himself  Did he die in an auto accident  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself  when you read about a new murder  is he back M.J. That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good. All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious... M.J. I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone. That would be much appreciated. Thanks. M.J. Somewhere down the line we're doing to find a connection between him and you.  I want you to worry that idea like a loose tooth. You and MaryJane aren't lovers. Are you always so bold Well.  Another time, then. I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben. Oh, God!  Help me! I'm falling!  I'm going to fall! ...falling... FALLING! Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die! The lock... Will you stay  Please  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want... him ...in my head... V.O. Peter... Peter... CROSS FADE TO I'm not seeing anybody. You're fired. That's no surprise. M.J. But it's a different m.o. Then what do you need me for M.J. She was killed somewhere else and Where it says no dumping.  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so  the same. Artificial and posed ... Something's wrong with it. You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure... M.J. Who turned off the Internet computer... I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in... M.J. He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the onswitch Have you got a warrant  Get the hell out o here!  This is the only space I have left in the world !  Why can't you leave me out of it M.J. Helen  the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is intense .  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate. That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood. M.J. Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside. Hello... Oh... ...yes, she's right here. Ruben. M.J. Hello, Ruben... So that's that... Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night. M.J. Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you for taking care of her last night. Lab report on the new one.  At least two guys penetrated her. There were two poor thing.  What it must have been like. She was near a sign that said No Dumping  Two kinds of sperm the lab said one was a secretor and the other was not There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood. M.J. So far nothing they test for comes up positive. Is that it M.J. That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning. He's switched from DeSalvo to the Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler was two men, that's why there are two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a joke, very witty our boy. M.J. That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots... Consistency is the hobgoblin of little for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with... M.J. I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows... It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims. M.J. appalling Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o. Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught he didn't. M.J. He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up... Who's going to catch him  You And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that. M.J. You're afraid of him. This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants. M.J. I'm giving you Clint outside. You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me! M.J. I did not the Mouth  that's what we call Susan Schiffer  got it on her own. Why should I trust you M.J. Because I'm all you've got. How could you... M.J. I like the real smart Helen Hudson a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and tired of the hysterical little girl, Helen.  You asked your way in I don't forget that.  You've got a nickname around here  Deep Throat from all the phone calls, I wonder if you know that.  Go take a xanax, I've got to got to work. It's a woman shot in a car She on the passenger side M.J. heard Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work... What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba. Don't hang up! Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby Is there a phone booth there Go and look for a note. She was listening to Abba in her parked car when she was shot with a Bulldog .44. M.J. Tony! M.J. Let me see the slug outta the door! M.J. What's that siren One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going... M.J. Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work... .  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to M.J. Helen, Ruben's going to drop by. He's got some questions. M.J. Answer me!!... M.J. I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda Drive.  Tell them to approach code 2 and wait for instruction.  Find the goddamn officer supposed to be on security.  Ruben's on his way. He'll go in alone. Why don't you shoot off the lock He was in my apartment! You think you're my Daddy They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it. What else Once that you've decided on a killing First you make a stone of your heart And if you find that your hands are still willing You can turn murder into an art... Dr. Hudson  Don't lose your head. Once that you've decided on a killing First you make a stone of your heart And if you find that your hands are still willing You can turn murder into an art. Well, if you have a taste for this experience You're flushed with your very first success Then you must try a twosome or a threesome Before your conscience bothers you much less. Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious In history's great dark hall of fame All of our greatest killers were industrious At least the ones that we all know by name. ...I'll be back... M.J. Yeah.  Addressed to you.  Don't lose your head. They put  Merry Saks M.J. He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem. What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me... fast, controls it You don't feel fear, do you You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful. M.J. I put my ass on the line, giving you that. They weren't going to show it to me!  The arrogance!  It's my life ! M.J. It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore. Look at the order he's doing Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on  to where and what end  And he's doing more than that he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can  in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba. It's not chronological Son of Sam was before Hillside. M.J. It's clear he thinks he knows me. He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't lose your head.'  Is that a threat Does he want to cut off my head Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else Kemper.  Did Gacy  Rivkind  I think Rivkind did. He attacks what he feels he can't have.  What he feels excluded from... 'First you make a stone of your heart.'... Oh yes! He suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our turn. Kemper said in order to have the experience he wanted with them, he needed to evict them from their bodies.  By making the body a completely passive object, he releases himself But the relief he feels is only temporary.  '...Before your conscience bothers you much less...'  But the tension always comes back. the words 'You can join the ranks of the illustrious...'  He wants to be like them .  The best.  To become the best.  But, he has his own desires, his own compulsions apart from theirs.'  His own horrors... Some horrors that are all his own... He needs to prove they don't control him, that he's the one in control.  But the feeling of power never lasts.  He can control his victims, but he can't control anything else... his place in the world.  He want s to be recognized. He puts messages in my computer he sends me a letter... Of course he wants to do a threesome!  Only Bundy did three in one day.  Is Bundy next  But Bundy should be last... the grand finale. What about Kemper and Ramirez Gacy, Dahmer, Williams  Rivkind Who else is on his list  In what order Not guilty !' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle '...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest heroes He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars. M.J. They get fan letters... Would you fax those pages to me M.J. Thank you for your help, Warden Hillyer.  As soon as you can. If we keep going and work till midnight... You've got a date right here , Andy. This has got to... Stop acting like a silly little fag! You bastard! The dirty bastard!  More games! It's not a real name it's the name of a mass murderer in Germany in the 1930s.  They called him the Monster of Dusseldorf. Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones... M.J. They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones he's so encouraging you make that your bastard. Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum You do that one, I don't want it... Not a damn bit... INTERCUT TO Hello, Daryll Lee. What book I'll look for it, Daryll Lee. I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten. Ah ha.  What did he want I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is. I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place. Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten In jail. ... their compulsion is less about sex than it is about control. Power.  Action.  Release from passivity.  Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer... because the boy just wanted to go home.  Bundy said he wanted to master life.  And death... Peter Kurten! You were right!  He knew me!  He went to my lectures.  He recorded them!  Listen to this... What happened to you! M.J. Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he... M.J. I just thought it was so unprofessional.  Of you both! He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man. M.J. A man  I thought he was a boy. This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch married men !  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy! You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy. M.J. Where's the john  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work. Who's the married man M.J. What does it matter  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes... M.J. Look.  There's the order  you wrote it  DeSalvo, Bianchi Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man. Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that... M.J. Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech... Maybe you should... M.J. I'm working on it!  It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here records Out.  Where does he go  Nowhere. What does he do  Nothing. I am not going to talk about it. How do you know head was gone  Where is the head Are you looking for it  Oh, God, why him  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him. M.J. I've got to go.  I've got M.J. How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep WWe had a fight.  I called him... called him a name... M.J. Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this  and there's no time.  Knock yourself out. Right.  Well.  He's going to do Bundy.  Bundy faked injuries, wore a plaster cast, or walked on crutches, and asked college girls for help  carrying his books, pushing his car... M.J. V.O. Like the others  he'll pick the most extravagant murder  Bundy's three murders in one night at a... M.J. ...Chi Omega sorority house.  Find out how many Chi Omegas there are on college campuses this area. Any student name registered in CrimePsych 137 matched to titles of term papers with any mention of 'Peter Kurten.' Peter Foley.  Good God.  You poor sad little bore.  I failed you, is this what... Where have you been What happened to your wallet I don't believe it. M.J. Helen. I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top. They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph... M.J. Helen  let go.  You've got to let go. He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape. M.J. This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk. If there's a one percent possibil ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again M.J. Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous. Where are you Who was the man in the basement Where are you, Peter It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it You know I can't do that. For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me. You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry  you have to have a male cop. Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come  just let her go.  She's not important. Where it began  McCluskey Auditorium. It's all over, Fred.  They got the guy.  You go home to your own bed now. Call in.  Use my phone.  They'll tell you  it's all over. Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped. He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people... He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me... Kill me, Peter, do it, now. Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it. I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it. That's not who I admire  I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers... If you let me, I can make you more famous than any of them. Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness... Do it.  For God's sake, now ... The only one who could tell you what you really need to know is dead. Why can't I drive home  I will. You.  Look at you. You home.  And you don't even know it. M.J. Well, thanks.

Listen to them!  We'll be on all three channels. No.  Not yet. Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer  you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something else you.

I see it in you... you're the same as me. Oh, no. We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... Why did you do that  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you  the ones you admired were the great murderers they fascinated you. I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument. Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  Let me help you...

Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nationwide resources and hard state of the art forensic science you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran M.J. Over here. We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have my Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson M.J. Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't... I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note. M.J. Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop... We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day... M.J. She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes. Who prescribes the brandy M.J. How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's wellpaid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement. M.J. Okay. We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it. What about auto body and paint shops any recent VW bug repainted to gold or yellow M.J. You or us gonna do it Got him! Well, thank you, too. Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...

148,BERLIN,Jennifer Eight,1992,False,"My name's John .. and I'm an alcoholic .. I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting .. But I wanna say a couple of things I hope may be of use, particularly as Benny says, to the new faces here. I first came into this fellowship ten months ago. I came to a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my last  how could a buncha drunks help me Then someone got up, I think it was Micky, and described himself as the shit around which the universe revolved. I don't know if that was original to him  it doesn't matter, it was the first time I'd heard it, and I still can't think of a better way to describe how I felt  We all have our own place in the darkness, and I was in such a mess I could hardly fucken see  I'd lost someone very dear to me  she hadn't died I had  I don't know whether she left coza the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew she was gonna leave  either way, the booze won  I replaced her with alcohol  anger I was angry with her, myself, everyone and everything  Where I was I wanted to be someplace else  any place but here  any moment but now  But here I am, and it is now, and there's a big change about to hap pen in my life  and I'm going for it coz this time I know I'm not running away  I'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey, and I feel good about myself going there So I stopped off to share that with you and to thank everyone of you, and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here, free .. I hope I'm not intruding Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife. I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him You need some hands up here to look .. No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a tourist. Week or two.  Musta been on the ker osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine. Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed .. Cut your own throat, you're ner vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one. My pleasure .. Who's Popeye So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing What about that kid, Ross Looks like a woman's hand I think you're here all day. We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs Two dogs. He should do the dogs. Alright, I'm coming .. Another intrusion from the radio. TRAVIS repeats the question. Yeah, he can go ... It's good to be with you, Ross. Is this normal Freddy Forever  he was my serg eant when I was a kid  don't get to see a lot of each other  but we been buddies two hundred years .. I think he would have if he could have  been trying to get me up here long enough  I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire .. Do me a favor, Travis  Bring in the resta the stuff from my car No .. But we have a theory .. Maybe he's lying to you Why did he ask if it was frozen Listen, my time isn't good  but two things  really important  the bras siere I sent you  I need to know if those stains are human blood  and if they are, do they match the blood in the sample  C'mon, gimme a break, I don't know anyone up here, it would take two weeks  C'mon, Ronny, I'm ask ing nice I really need to know wheth er I'm interested in that brassiere .. You're my favourite man  raining I gotta go  Ronny  I gotta go  I got a house fulla removal men and a date at the morgue  And, Ron, Con gratulations  you're my first call .. You say the cut's left to right Isn't that unusual He's left handed Depends how healthy it is. If it's any good, I'll try and get a print .. Oh, Ross, that newspaper guy at the station, asked me if the hand was frozen Why would he ask me that Who is who Not for me .. Not today .. I'm on a diet to day .. I'll take a diet soda .. O.K. Not too good in daylight .. Would you drop these off for me You know something strange about that hand I think it was frozen Yeah. What does that mean to you C'mon, Venables, you're a policeman. And policemen always have an answer Well, what Where do I find the file on that No. Been dead two weeks. What time is it Why so coy about the word frozen There's nothing in the files Look  1  2  34  5  6   7 .. I count eleven scars on this hand, and four that might be .. Now I count em on my hand Five. I'm 42 years old.  This girl's about 18 How come she's got so many scars So tell me about Jennifer You know I'm gonna find out. I already did. What's his problem It's a method for quitting smoking. It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..

I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is Yes, Sir. Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left,  was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K. O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft ernoon she left Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.

Can you give me any idea what this fellow was like Well, d'you know how old he was Alright, let me put it this way How old d'you think I am Twenty six Thirtynine Or fiftythree You must have some idea about him. No. John .. You never said that on the phone .. What makes you think his name was John This looks promising .. I think this one could be it Let me just keep going a while.

Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. We're going. Maybe not I'm feeling lucky .. Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it .. I haven't got it. Why I had one puff on a pipe. What do you want it for What are you doing, Ross I've had that 15 years! .. I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent imental attachment to that. No! Get me to that garbage dump! I'm gonna find that fucking dog! You didn't shoot him did you Berlin .. yeah .. that's nice of you, Helena, but I already found out .. black, yes .. No, no, of course not, good of you to call .. You heard a what .. A hollow car Yes, I'm still here .. Why didn't you mention that .. I see .. Al right, we should talk again .. No, I'm just south of my eyelids in it right now .. How about Sunday .. I put the slug in for a ballis tics report, the man tells me, for get it. Soft lead, it's worthless .. I think, fuck it. And fuck Citrine. I call a friend of mine in Los Ang eles, and he runs our whole damned show through a mainframe looking for anything similar to our ladies shot with a twentytwo  you don't believe what he finds in San Diego .. Would you shut it down a min ute, Ross This is important. Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen tytwo in the back of the head. They possibly did  but they nev er had a head, so they never had a bullet  and they never got an I.D.  not on any of em  never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is  we're the first to get a positive identity. That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you. I wanna take that fucking Blind In stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years .. We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is Jennifer Eight. That old Wino on the heap wasn't a suicide. He stumbled into some thing, saw something, and whoever took him out knew how to fake it. I was wrong. I'm going in to see Citrine this afternoon. Will you come with me You believe me, don't you No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door  no one home, so I followed the music .. No problem. I'm not in a hurry. Matter of fact, I saw a little restaurant place down the road. Looked kinda pretty I thought maybe we could have some lunch Alright, whatever .. Was some one in here with you When I came in the door was flapping I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a hollow car Of course I would .. What are you staring at, Hel ena .. I mean .. I'm sorry .. I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out. What are you reading No. .. I'll tell you what, if I prom ise to stop being a cop, will you promise to stop being a witness I mean, we don't havta sit here waiting for me to ask the next question You could ask one, too No. Well, I'm glad we got the conver sational side of lunch over with. There's no one looking at you .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me. Was. But I don't like to talk about it. I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that. Yeah, that'll do .. Is that Hamlet I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing Pray No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers  He said, prayers Not often. They're Junk Mail. .. I got really sick of the street .. so I went to school and became a Scientific Services Officer, which is basically a Scene of Crime Off icer. Then this came up, and I got what they call a Lateral Transfer .. I couldn't take another minute of Los Angeles .. Felt like I'd said sorry in every street in the city .. .. sorry your father, mother sis ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee .. No. Getting dark though. You think you'd know this man If he was in the room with you again Yes. I'm sorry. Coz this is a major  we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been. He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow. No. No, Sir. It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing. If you're not gonna hear me, Chief .. We have a multiple homicide, Sir .. All but .. How you doing I wish he'd tell that to Citrine. He thinks the kid shot the dog .. He didn't. You looked like you did He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flashburn. It was pointblank. Is she lying, Ross My name's Sergeant John Berlin. I been a policeman 17 years 16 years 9 months of which with the L.A.P.D. I witnessed literally hundreds of liedetector tests, and I never seen one like this Well, look at it. Look at this line That's the important one. Dead straight down the page. No body gets a dead straight down the page. Even our expert says a dead straight's exceptional. Thought you might wanna comment You busted the box, lady! You flunk ed it .. You lied about things you didn't need to lie about .. The only truthful statement you made's your name .. Your name is Carol Emerson You tell one more lie, you're go ing in a cell. Sergeant Ross is coming in to take your statement. I'm doing it by the day ... How's your little sister Working Car accident. Whole family wiped out. It's been a great day. She runs a kind of hair dress ing and you know, beauty salon .. I was married to her sister .. You don't ask what I'm like How d'you know what I'm like Really What did he say He said that What else did he say Which is what You wanna drive C'mon we're in a car park, miles from any where .. There's nothing arou nd but nothing and sand dunes .. C'mon it'll be fun. You can drive me around in circles .. We're going along a little track. It's O.K. It's not a public road. It's alright, I'm sorry. It was my fault, it wasn't a good idea. A Volkswagen van Are you sure .. is it a two door, slide door, a what I don't know Well, you gotta get closer than just a V.W. van. You 're talking maybe 1015 thousand veh icles What happens if you just run the name John against all of them Frankly, that isn't gonna do you any good. You'll be knocking on doors all over the state. You gotta request tho se Jennifer files  maybe something in them, give us some kinda reference I can't request anything right now .. push one more inch, I lose the lot .. Well, listen, I'll run the Bay Area for you. But if you want a printout of every John in California with a V. W. van, that's gotta be official. I'm sorry .. That's O.K. Thank you, Dan .. Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman Three or four. Once. That's bullshit, I never asked if he could see. I just asked one or two of the stud ents if they remembered anything No. God, it pisses me off, Ross. A sailor How come he's suddenly so forth coming I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .. I never knew about the sailor the ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files Just makes to so God damned mad .. She wasn't lying about the van. Sure. Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my Nervous Tick ... .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J .. Vehicle references. I have to talk to you, Helena. You know How do you know Got your driver's license I noticed you coming outta the institute. You up there a lot No, it was you that nearly ran into me .. You up there a lot Where's your store, Amanda Next pitstop, you make sure your doors are locked.  Merry Christmas. You put it in there. Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment  you gave him the whole damned case! So read it! You just hung a target around her neck! Don't you know nothing about this guy He reads the newspapers. Col lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down  tried .. Just walk away from me, Taylor .. You don't know what you done, Taylor. I know what a witness is. I'm gonna do something you never did, Taylor. I'm gonna catch this bastard. And when I do, he's gon na find out just how good a wit ness she is .. Meanwhile, you be aware of me  coz I wish you ill .. Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion. One hundred fucking per cent! .. And you know why Coz I never told her goodbye. O.K. Is that good enough for the committee No .. You didn't know that .. Here. You left your booze in here. That's a very stupid question, Ross. How the hell do I know who Some jerkoff. Some peepingtom prick. .. but definitely not him. This guy's in the trade. He's not gon na stand there looking at her ass, if he's in the room, she's dead .. I'm sick of this toy town shit. Don't give me that! Not another word! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes. So as far as I was concerned, she's ly ing. And if the King of fucking England had walked in  told me different, I wouldn't have bel ieved him  because you told me .. And now I'm telling you. I'm looking you right in the eyes and telling ya, there's a bad man out there, and I don't know if he's in the next room, or the next state and I don't know what his trigger is But if he reads her name in the newspaper, I believe he'll be inclined to do something ab out it. I've got a bad feeling. And I been doing this too long to be wrong. I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there .. Screw Citrine. He can fire me. Has he got your aunt's address Who Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K. You're looking worried again, Helena You're looking more worried now than when you decided to stop worrying He'll get over it. I'll roast us a chicken, O.K.  With cand les around it. How about that Can't thank you enough, Ross .. No. Are you sure you didn't call Someone's calling the institute to talk to Helena. Says he wants to ask her some more questions .. You got a quiet phone somewhere That's just what I wanna find out. Jesus. What are you doin Have you got any Glasers Twenty fives I'm going up to the institute. This cop that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas. I checked with the locals and our station, no one's called. Whoever it is, isn't the police.  I think this bastard's getting worried ab out something .. and I think the re's just a chance he'll turn up. Listen, you don't havta come I guess by the bed. Bull shit .. I'm in my prime .. What d'you mean, bits. Hit those wipers, Ross. We're not here. I don't want the desk to hear us .. Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down. That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living .. Me, Freddy. Where's Margie Does he know I want you to go to your Aunt's. It's not possible right now. Please don't ask no quest ions now .. Not right now .. Margie .. She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight. No .. not now .. What are you doing, Travis Why You got a warrant for this Who sought the warrant I want a 24 hour protection of Margie's house. Otherwise I'm not saying nothing. You give me that, or read me my rights, and talk to a lawyer. I want Serato .. Why can't I have Serato I have done .. St ANNE Alright, let's not beat about the bush, what ever that may mean, and get down on it. You were specific ally instructed by your chief, not to go anywhere near the blind inst itute So why did you go up there Because of a feeling. I had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up. St ANNE Which man is that The man I detail in my report, Sir. Is this an interview, or an interrogation St ANNE It's an enquiry ... I'm not prepared to be interrog ated. I'll be interviewed as an officer, who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator. St ANNE Well, that's fine by me, John. And I'm sure that's fine by your Chief. So you thought your man might show Yes. St ANNE Bit of a longshot, wasn't it It was the only shot I had .. St ANNE So the one night you decide to go up there, he goes up there That's right. Except I'd decid ed to go up there every night .. St ANNE Despite the wishes of your Chief Yes. St ANNE You were prepared to fal sify your reports to him I had very good reasons for do.... St ANNE Just a second, John. I knew there was something missing. You don't mind if I jump around a little this morning, do you Just while I'm easing my way into this You're asking the questions, Sir .. St ANNE You had an argument with Ross Ass aulted one of the officers, right I wouldn't use the word assault. St ANNE You got a racy temper, Sergeant Not especially. St ANNE Just something they did, on this occasion, made you lose your rag Not they. He. Taylor put a piece in the newspaper, which in my op inion put my witness in jeopardy. St ANNE From whom From the man I detail in my rep ort. A crazy man, who to my cert ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls. Six in San Diego, one someplace else, and one up here .. St ANNE Not a lotta support for that scenario though, is there Not a lot. St ANNE Not even from Ross No. St ANNE Is that why you lost your temper with him Frustration No one believing you So what can you tell me about you man What do you mean, Sir St ANNE I mean, who is he I don't know who he is. Who's Jack The Ripper He's Jack The Ripper with an automobile. St ANNE You didn't run a profile No, Sir .. I didn't have the res ources, and it isn't my expertise. St ANNE This crazy man What makes you think he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson You read my report, Sir. St ANNE I'm asking a question .. Because he reads I'm investigating the disappearance of her friend, Miss Robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety. How good of a witness is she He's crazy, but not stupid, he's intelligent. Got a flexible M. O., and he doesn't wanna get caught. St ANNE Just like Jack The Ripper Alright, we'll have plenty of time to discuss your Mystery Man, and his flexibility later, Right now, I'd like to talk about the event. St ANNE BERLIN Alright, the door comes back and hits you Knocks you down Knocks you out For how long I don't know Approximately, you figure A minute O.K. O.K. then what happened Immediately you get up I realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs St ANNE Did you check your weapon Maybe. It would have been instinctive. All I know was I was in possession of it .. St ANNE You didn't check it Not that I specifically remember. St ANNE Why not I don't know. I wasn't think ing about it .. I was dazed .. St ANNE You were woozy Confused I was unconscious 10 seconds ago. St ANNE I understand. Then Then I picked up the flashlight, tried to get Ross on the radio .. Nothing. Static. I got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut. St ANNE Could you see out of it Yeah, I could see. Then I ran. Climbed out of the window, ran down the fire escape, and right at the bottom, I found Ross .. St ANNE Were you breathless Sure I was breathless ... St ANNE When did you realize you were no longer in possession of the .25 Not until I was in the hospital. St ANNE You figure you lost it in the hospital Or on the way there No, I thought it must have fallen down the stairwell. St ANNE BERLIN Like the flashlight Yeah Had you been drinking that night It was Christmas Eve. St ANNE That wasn't my question Yes. St ANNE BERLIN How about Ross Sure Were you drinking in the car There was a bottle in the car I think Ross had a mouthful St ANNE But not you I may have had a nip St ANNE To keep out the cold .. Very cold that night, very windy, wasn't it Which hand was the flashlight in My left hand. St ANNE And the Walther was in your right The Beretta was in my right hand .. St ANNE You said you didn't check it So how d'you know which gun you're holding You said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight You said you were confused You pick up the flashlight in confusion, how d'you know you didn't pick up the 25 Let's not start playing games, Mr St Anne. St ANNE Games I told you, I'd lost the Walther .. St ANNE You told me you didn't know you'd lost it until you were in the hos pital So, if you didn't know till then, it coulda been either weapon The gun in my hand was a Beretta. And for the record, I want that note corrected. Now, please, Sir. St ANNE O.K. I'm corrected. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. With respect, Sir, you didn't make a mistake. I know who you are, and you're far too experienced for mis takes. Now if you have doubts over the content, or veracity of my rep ort, I wanna be made aware of them St ANNE Sure. I wanna be made aware of them now. St ANNE Do you want a lawyer, Sergeant There you go again Do I want a lawyer, Sergeant It's a game question. What do I want a law yer for I got nothing to hide .. St ANNE You don't You know I don't. So let's quit the bullshit and get down to it. What's your angle, Mr St Anne St ANNE Where's the little gun, Sergeant I've no idea. St ANNE You don't If it isn't in the institute, the man who shot Ross took it. St ANNE The man who shot Ross, used it .. And you don't know where that little twentyfive calibre Walther's gone O.K. Sergeant, here it is. I intend to produce evidence, that will prove you shot Frederick Ross with malice afore thought. My angle therefore, is to pre pare a case on behalf of your Chief, to prosecute you for first degree murder. St ANNE You go home, John, get some sleep. I don't wanna talk any more today. Aren't you gonna arrest me St ANNE You know better than that ... I arrest you, you'll get bail, and be walking outta here anyway  and I'll have no one to talk to  Your Chief said he'd make you available to me. If you go to the store, call in, and let your duty officer know. No. St ANNE Tell us what happened, then I already told you what happened .. You're looking for an inconsisten cy, and you're not gonna find one, because I'm telling you the truth. St ANNE Tell me the truth again. St ANNE You have .. How about the booze .. Too much booze can be very dangerous .. memory black outs .. stuff like that .. The Man Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes the Man .. Something like that, isn't it .. Anyway .. why did you give up I guess I was drinking too much. St ANNE I was talking about cigarettes Find yourself getting breathless Sure. St ANNE Specially if you're running Which floor did the elevator run up to Five. St ANNE You ran up to the fifth You must have been real breathless by then We're gonna get our observer in here this afternoon. Keep an eye on us He smiles Notorious for withholding information, the F.B.I. Were you aware there was a janit or in the institute that night No. St ANNE You didn't check There wasn't time ... St ANNE That wasn't my question No, Sir, I didn't check. St ANNE I'm really catching cold up here Must be all this fog What's the relevance of the janitor St ANNE The janitor Let me just ask you a question  before I forget  do you take any medication for that For what St ANNE Breathlessness No. St ANNE Alright, let me answer your question What's the relevance of the janitor Why don't I take you through it, from where I'm sitting .. At some time bet ween 2  230 a.m. the janitor thought he heard a vehicle approaching through the woods. He looks out, and sees noth ing, no lights, nothing. Figures it must be hunters. Some time later, he thought he heard something else, like a door, or a window slam He gets up, and between half past two and a quarter of three, he makes a search  with a flashlight  of the top 3 floors. Finds nothing untoward, goes back to his apartment in the roof. The flashlight you saw, was his. The footsteps you heard, were his. The elevator you were chasing up and down after was empty, and is prone to such activity, due to an electrical fault .. Apparently it happens frequently dur ing gales. The gale that was swinging the door. That knocked you down. That confused you so much And here we are, back to where I'm sitting. You wanna tell me what really went on that night Two people know I didn't kill him, Mr St Anne. One's me, and the other's the man that did. St ANNE What man We just dealt with the man How d'you know the Jan itor didn't shoot him You're telling me it's his flashlight I saw, O.K., he sees my flashlight And I'm coming up the stairs with a Beretta in my hand. And he's frightened. He hits the door on me. Picks up my gun. He's running. He runs into Ross, and in panic, he shoots him. St ANNE Not unless he had a gun in one hand, and a phone in the other, he didn't. Ross was shot at ex actly two fiftyseven a.m. The janitor put a call through to the local police, at 257 a.m. You obviously realize how I can get so accurate with my timing Ross switched into channel 8, we got a recording of the whole incident. I was gonna play it to you, but I got a meeting, we'll have to do it after lunch. It's one, let's make it back by three I need a friend, Angelo. .. I know why you did it darlin, but you're not helping me. Every thing they're hearing they think is a lie. Now here comes the man I'm desperate to prove exists, whaddayaknow, he turns up at my house, and has a chat with you No one in the State of California is gonna believe that. They got the man in there  an A1 F.B.I. inter rogator, and he's taking me to pie ces  doesn't believe a word comes outta my head  not a word  no one believes me  I don't believe me .. I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand. The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in stitute to kill you  he don't wanna kill Rose  he was there to kill you  that's the truth and I didn't wanna tell it to you  but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's coz I can't protect you here .. Coz he thinks you're a witness. He don't know that. I didn't. Will you fucken stop it. I'm not Serato .. He didn't kill you coz he wasn't here .. he isn't in the room with you, and lets you live .. A breath freshener ... he's either here to take something .. or leave some thing .. I don't find nothing .. He doesn't need my help. You do Ross was my best friend. St ANNE Did you shoot your best friend No. St ANNE The next time I ask you that quest ion, you're gonna tell me the truth. TAPE .. Just be careful now, coz I'm coming up. .. Footsteps on cast iron stairs Is that you, John .. Answer .. Now .. or I blow this fucken staircase to pie ces. Sound of someone breathing hard Me, Freddy. .. Just the gale What the hell's going on up there, Brother I been calling ton minutes. .. Lungs heave for air Hey, c'mon, John, talk to me Just the sound of breathless ness Jesus Christ .. What are you do ing What the fuck are you doing It's me  Holy shit  John  John  Not you Don't shoot you crazy bastard! 2 shots St ANNE That's second degree  you wanna stop at that Will you give me that, John He ain't offerin me shit. You're letting it show, King Jay. You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart .. I think they're gonna arrest me. It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance  find the best damned lawyer there is .. I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call ed Ross Freddy in my life .. You haven't. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut. St ANNE Tell a lotta lies, don't you Some thing that comes naturally to you I don't lie. St ANNE Prepared to lie to your Chief Under exceptional circumstances. St ANNE What were the circumstances that caused you to lie to Freddy Ross I never lied to Ross .. St ANNE You didn't Well, he thought you did .. Wrote it down in his book John Berlin is a liar. Right here, underlined. Dated the day you got your first break with your Mystery Man You don't know why he wrote that Maybe he thought there was no Myst ery Man That the investigation was bullshit That you were making it up Coz you wanted to be Top Cop Isn't that why you went running up that gar bage dump, so everyone could stand in awe of the Top Cop Isn't that why you came up here Coz you couldn't make it in L.A. Get yourself a pissy lit tle degree, come up here, and be Top Guy But Ross was Top Guy, wasn't he Always would be Top Guy And you know what He did it without even trying .. Everybody loved him. He had everything you wanted, didn't he  Great woman Great kid  Everything you couldn't have  And you wanted it to go away Coz your life was lousy, wasn't it A lousy life, with a lousy wife, who was fucking everyone, wasn't she Is that why you pick on a little Blind Girl  coz you can control her  Is that it  Control who she's fucking You wanna lose your temper with me C'mon, John, lose your fucken temper You're good at losing your temper.. No way, Mr St Anne. St ANNE Lost your temper with Ross, didn't you C'mon, tell me the truth. Is that what happened You had an arg ument in the car Lost your temper with him Stood over him, blew his fucking larynx out with a Glaser Where were you aiming, John Going for his face Blow his fucking face away, because you hated him so much.

Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her. How could you see her  She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.

Okay Is that enough Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this. Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot fudge. Oh, Ted. Ted. She wasn't murdered.

I'm gonna have four cards. Yeah. Inside and outside straight. You know, I can't escape the feeling that mymy wife is becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really bothering me. Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens. Yeah, I do. I do. Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with. Yeah. MaybeMaybe I should actually make a greater effort with with Carol. Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera. Would you rather be here with Ted More enthused Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy. You know, TedTed would be fun on a scavenger hunt. You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt. He's the man. Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took you out on a date when wewe first started going out. Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner. Not to change the subject. I took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first date Who knew they were flashbacks  You know. Are you gonna burst into a song, here  We're in a car. Let me ask you a personal question, here. Did you ever sleep with Ted Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys... We were on an eating tour of France, together. You two guys spent an evening, you know, together. At that place, you know. That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me. You know that. SheShe thought I was a lowlife and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. JustJust jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know. Hoho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !... Yeah. Oh my god, it is. Can you... Are you sure  Are you sure Oh, my God. I'm... Jesus, I'm sh... That is her. Are you... Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here. What What How  How And came in with awith a canvas bag, and an umbrella. Mrs. Caine Mrs. Caine. Uhhuh. WeWe had a present for her. We're friends. WeWe wanted to surprise her, because it's her birthday, soso... Yeah, wewe may need some information, while we're here, soso, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care of you, if you play ball with us. What are you making that face for  He's the father of our country. I'm coming, I'm coming. Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard. Mrs. House Hallo I don't... I don't... I don't think she's... This may not be the rightright place. There's nothing here. What's the matter Oh, Jesus. What's the matter WhatWhatWhat... What WhatWhat's... Dead  TTTryTry giving her the present. Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here ! Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon. This woman is forever dying. Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears. Get down those stairs. Come on, come on. Quickly. WeWeWe were there. SheShe was very nervous. SoSo we were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as best as I could. What do you mean, there's nobody up... We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor. She was totally dead. Wait, wait. Yeah, she was definitely laying here. The... YYes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. NotNot that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know. Right, I'm a... II work at Harper's. I'm in publishing. Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, butbut she's a wonderful cook. Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It tooktook you three minutes, notnotnot counting the halfhour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying. Any witnesses Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something. Ted  TedTed's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly. Helen  I don't know and... I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives. We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico. You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car or something. I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see aa dead body. You know, I always hated those shows. I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninetyfour years old. He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals. This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all. Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep, tonight. That'll be good for me. Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean, what do you want me to do  I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk. Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr. House, because he has an alibi. She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get out of here. I want to go home. Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve. You know what I think  I think it's possible. That hotel room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall. It's right up there. That's the room. Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof You know, that would be a possibility. Why would... Oh, Jesus. Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it Yeah, well, let's call the police. Check it out What, are you nuts  No, I'm not gonna check that out. Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the... What do you mean, it's your case Hey, come here. I don't want to do this. No. Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots. I'm at least just trembling like a leaf. My what Yeah, II... No, no, no, no, no. ImI'mI'mI'm j... I'mI'm ju... um... I'm a detective. TheyTheyThey lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. Theyre, they're... ...expensive. Be careful. I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave aa set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped. I don't like this. Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple. Shhh !... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... II, oh, it's It'sIt's a... You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And nonono croissants tomorrow for breakfast. Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh... Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble. Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued. That's what How do you know You did Jesus. So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open. I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff. We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean  This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this  This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it. Jesus ! What is that Why are we stopping  Why are we stopping Don't tell me to relax ! I'mI'mI'm aa worldrenowned claustrophobic. Stop. Hit something. I don't like this, I don't, I don't... It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.

I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a stallion. I'm a stallion. There'sThere's a cool breeze passing over me. I see grass. I see dirt. You know, you said, you said, Act as a policeman. I said No. You said Pretend to be a policeman. You said Show him your card. I said What card. You know, I ca... I can't get through those things. It'll never open, they're painted shut. They'reThey're... TheyThey never, they... they never open. I'm breathing. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

The worst part of it is, I'm driving a used car. I'm scared. Oh, my God. It's her. Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a neurotic's jackpot. We're going down. We're going down. Press up  I can't see my hand. How can I press up  Jesus. The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm returning shoes. It's dark in here. Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator.

An author. Jesus. I like a basement withwith knotty pine and a pool table. You know, where you can... What  What I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here, it's dank. And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I don't know. This... Oh, Jesus ! Calm down  Don't tell me to calm down. This... WhWh... II don't... What do you... Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand back. Don't worry. JustJust give me a second. Must be one of those new doors. Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises. Where  Where you...

I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna follow him. I know, I saw that there was a... I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it. It'sIt's probablyIt's probably a rented car. And a rented body. Oh, Jesus. II can't c... I can't follow his car. Where, up ahead  I don't know which car I'm following here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you know, I'llI'llI'll wind up hitting a school bus or something. Don't tell me that. What about night school You have no sense of direction. I was... You have no sense of direction. Where the hell are we  What is this I don't know, but... What How do you know it's his car Oh, it is his car. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, let me turn the light off. Be careful, be careful, be careful. Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body ! Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped. Good bye, Mrs. House. That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House. I'm gonna call the Police, now. And get them... What are we... Ohhh !... SheSheShe gets cremated. She gets killed at the end. Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh  I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a... Either she's a twin, or he's a twin. Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin. Because I don't know what's going on. You know, look. Let me be logical about this. Hey. Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out. Yeah, I'm going to be logical. The, um, the first thing is this. We came home that night. There had been a heart attack. Uh, what if they induced it  You know, some kind of poison. We never saw the body. You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know. Mrs. House could have been hiding. But youyou remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel. I can't sleep. I just, I... I'm too, you know... I'm too... Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them. Yeah, so what  So what  It's so, you know, TedTed was taking her to a show and tototo dinner... so they'll be there. So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is. Lucky me. Oh, no question about it. It wasIt was Mr. House. There was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there wasthere was just no way that you could avoid it. He was right there. Wh... How do you see it What do you mean That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term ballpark resemblance myself. It was my idea. I said what she said. This is my theory. Exactly my theory. Yeah. That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague. Cheating on two women The guy doesn't look the part. She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him. She's right, there's no body. Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying attention  This is a great theory. I think it's great. Oh, excuse me. Her mind, it just goes. Fantastic. I knew that they would hit it off. III knew this. What are you talking about I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you  I'm her editor. I'm I'm a father figure to her, how... You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia What'd wrong with you  You're jealous because he'she's interested in her. You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most. Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, soso... Right. Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call. This is perfect. No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never... This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because sshe's a, she's aan, actress, or wouldbe actress, anyhow, and you'reyoure... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow. Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything. And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we taperecord it. Listen to this. And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call... ...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House. This is perfect, list... It's coordinated. This is great. This is great. I like... No, it's great. It's great. What happens, is... it provokes him to kill again. They catch him the second time. You know what I'm thinking, though Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working the scheme on him. Um, well, I don't know. Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's. No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit. This is Helen Moss. I'm trying, I'm trying. He should be back for lunch, right So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right tape in All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh, we're on speaker. Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous. We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up. Somebody press something, come on. You can't press some... Come on. Great. All right. Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour and call Mr. House from a phone booth. Where are you... Where are you running so fast What's the matter  What are you so angry about  What are you so... What are you so steamed up about What are you talking about We had just a big success in there. Marcia likes to read what I like to read. You got stuff in common with Ted, right  You can cook together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and baste a chicken with him. Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear  Nothing, I'm her editor. I reevaluated our lives. I... I... I got a ten. You got a six. Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet. What are you talk... Hallo, Mr. House  This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna cost you, uh, 200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills. Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want to go that route. Oh, really  Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't... don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got Carol, put her on the phone. Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her ! Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I, uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes, I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In... in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise. I'll be there. I... I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff. Where's Carol I... I got it. No, no, I... I... I got... Why are you so nervous  What are you so nervous about If I don't have her, what are you so nervous I got her in the trunk of my car. I... I got her. I... I... No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got her ring  I got her ring, there. This is... This is her ring. It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh. I could never bluff. I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years. I'm not a bluffer. Carol  Carol  Carol God ! Are you okay  Are you okay Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee... Yes, and... and... and... a glazier. Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine. Wife mine. What an experience. I'm... I'm still vibrating. Incredible. What do you mean surprisingly You seem shocked. You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know. Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight  Let's not go to any restaurant where they serve cowards. I... What are you laughing at How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia  Isn't that ridiculous  Don't you know that I could only love you Ted You've got to be kidding.

Oh, and who else would it be, okay Right, right. Hidden, uh  Hidden away Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay  He lied. Ted ! Yeah. Where  Oh, I know where, ah ah. Snorkeling, right Ah ah.

You know what I mean  I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry. Oh my God ! Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. III heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, II looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator. Yeah, you know, I was... I'mI'm... almost certain that it was him. Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be I know. I know. But whwho would it be at onethirty in the morning But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying  A joke I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home. Yes, because this is really... It's very sus... Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait. That's one ring. Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet. What are you doing All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing. Keep ringing. Oh, man. I don't know.

He has a car, right  He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the... What do you mean, so what  He's... All right. So, I'm right, though. I mean, I'm right. Yes, he isn't in his apartment. Yeah, that's right. What about your rigidity  How about that How about that point Hi ! Jack Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I got a leak in the kitchen You can Well, but, it will be this afternoon. All right, you're not gonna go now In a minute. Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God. Ted... I'm in his apartment. The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel. He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay  Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, II'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done. Oh, stop being such a fuddydud. Yeah. It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in. Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay Okay He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. I told Ted. Yeah. He's more openminded about these things. Yeah. Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay He talked on the phone with a woman. Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so... Yeah, but I hid under the bed. He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all. He wasHe was very loveydovey with his kind of bimbo, you know  He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together. That kind of thing. I know, listen, II couldn't think that far ahead. No, I c... Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. HeHe called this woman back. Probably thisthis Helen Moss woman, right And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says  Tell her Tom called. You know what I'm saying  Tom. Tom, Larry. Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did... I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake. I left my reading glasses on his table. Oh, hallo. Hi. II thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert. I thought I'dI'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh. That'd be great. That's a great idea. Okay, that'd be really good. Come over here.

Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean Uh uh. That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under. They were just... They f... Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse. I remember. I know, but where... where are we going Yeah. Right. Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh Okay. Oh, I don't know.

158,MARCIA,Manhattan Murder Mystery,1993,False,"Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean... You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it. Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic. No, but I put myself through school playing poker. No, but I still know how. Yeah. I could turn your game around in two hours. Well, I wouldn't say beautiful. But I do have tremendous sexappeal.

How are you doing Hi. Good to see you. That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint. Great. Great. Well, good to see you. Good to see you. Take care. If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold. Got it That's how you wind up on welfare. Cut You seem in a strange mood. On Perrier Want any cards Four Cruising for a bruising. You're in trouble, now. Really. You must love her a lot. Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some effort. I mean, who's the guy Ted. Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your date. To me, it's obvious. Obvious he's committed the perfect murder. Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. They're with this woman. Maybe having dinner. They don't induce a heart attack, because that's fiction bullshit. She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously. They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she was dead. I don't know. Maybe they stood to gain if she died. They see a golden opportunity. Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides. That's right. She checks into a hotel. Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with this pretty young woman. He's cheating on his wife. So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he doublecrosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits. Yeah, a good chance she's aware. She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his wife. She said he was at work all day. She's a colleague who maybe loves him. The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder. There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free. Well, he doesn't care. Why should he  Everything's been neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth. When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to trap him. Okay, I've got it. Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no case. Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know  He was probably too scared to be very lucid. He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow  who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now, you can send him to the chair. If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down. Well, that's when we keep bluffing. We produce the body. Yeah. SaySay we found someone to corroborate this story. Someone he trusted. Like his lover. Say she called and said, Paul, I've just seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars for it. Remember that book you recommended to me  Murder in Manhattan In the book, they use several tape recorders. We coordinate it. He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks. Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder. What It's perfect. It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You shake him down. He comes after you, we nab him. Yeah. It's either that, or he walks. Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right Hi. Perfect. You did great. Great. Fantastic. There she is. You have to keep her busy for all afternoon. Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role. Good. We'll hook up later, okay All right, you too. Yeah. Go to a different thought. Okay, let's get off as quick as possible. We've done it. Shhh !... Um, okay. Sh !... Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay. Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time. Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years ago. She changed her name when she married. Her husband died. She moved back to New York recently, a very, very rich widow... but a recluse. Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will. They have her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over. I guessed right there. She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they fake it... Pretend Lillian House died. They cremate the sister. Lillian checks into a fleabag joint... and for several weeks she pretends to be her sister... closing her accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money. What she didn't realize was that her husband was twotiming her with Helen Moss, this pretty model. So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So, he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came along and tripped him up. Yeah, that woman that worked for him Mrs. Dalton  She covered for him. She loved him. Not that she dreamed he was a murderer. I think they wanna be alone.

162,WATSON,Sherlock Holmes,2008,False,"The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world  the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained. Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern. I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady. We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance. The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede. And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden... The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't. ... Sherlock Holmes. WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. 2. 1   CONTINUED                                                       1 The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant. Nice hat. Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs You left this behind. Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with distaste, doesn't take it. You did. Yeah, s'me. 6. 7    CONTINUED 3                                               7 8    OMITTED                                                      8 9    INT.

PENTONVILLE PRISON  CORRIDOR  DAWN                    26 Look at you, I can't believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a masochist Don't you remember what she did to you She turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I'm sorry, you were going to explain something... I know, instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time You dress up as clergyman and actually perform the ceremony. She'd love that. What's she after, anyway 36. 35   CONTINUED                                                    35 Go on.    I won't interrupt. What could she possibly need An alibi, a beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames... I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth. Case solved! You're just not her type, Holmes. She likes ginger dwarfs. So you agree I've upset you, I can tell.    I've said too much. 36A. 35     CONTINUED 2                                              35 Alright.   What were you just doing That's what I've been trying to do. Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW. 36     FLASHBACK  INT. 221 BAKER ST.  HOLMES' APARTMENT           36 We see Irene step out. Which is no mean feat. And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case. You know what, I've had just about enough Us means you. Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself. I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening. Are you taking this seriously Look at this mess. Nothing but standardissue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled. 38A. 42   CONTINUED                                                   42 He's in shock.     We should give him a few moments. He had no pulse. Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago. Missing two incisors in the upper jaw... Adler's midget. I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way. Just eat. You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible. 43. 51   CONTINUED 2                                               51 The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches. Pawnbroker's marks. Maddison and Haig. 43A. 51   CONTINUED 3                                               51 There's one thing you've missed. On the watch. The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you. No, thank you. You think you are clever don't you Enough. This is a new low  even for you. 44. 51   CONTINUED 5                                               51 Do you still have my cut from the fight Not bad, eh I can spare ten minutes. 55                                                                  55 Something did. 46. 55   CONTINUED                                                    55 Bloody hell...

Has he any hydrochloric acid 47. 56   CONTINUED                                                      56 Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt... He worked for Blackwood. Seems about fair. 49. 58    CONTINUED 2                                                58 Holmes! 65    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY  CONTINUOUS ACTION                      65 Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship EXPLODE BACKWARDS the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding down towards them. 52. 66    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY  CONTINUOUS ACTION                       66 Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard. Holmes lies semiconscious, eyes rolled back into his head, as the leviathan roars down towards him. The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against the runner  once, twice  as he blinks back into consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over him. He's doomed. And... The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself in the afterlife, and sees black metal an inch from his nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as 66A                                                                66A EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY  CONTINUOUS ACTION We see the chain extended taut as a tightrope behind the halflaunched ship. The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle and crack with the weight of the tethered ship. A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and... The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again, falling through the air Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the air above his head  the hull screams past him with a sound like the side of the world being torn off and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a vast, frothy explosion of water. Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the river  from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds. A quiet beat. Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet, but Dredger's boneshaking punches have taken it out of him and he sags back to the ground. Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they find 53. 66A   CONTINUED                                                  66A Nothing.   No blood or trace.   The big man is gone. The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene. They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and Watson. Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn. 67    INT. LONDON JAIL  MORNING                                    67 The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled. Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change here and there. Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking his head. I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail. Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's handkerchief. I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration. 54. 67   CONTINUED                                                   67 Why else would I continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me I'm not complaining... I never complain... I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire! Who could forget that face I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us! 54A. 67   CONTINUED 2                                               67 Nor am I complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog. What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary. If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her. You're not You're not human. You don't get it, do you You are this... head ... without this. There isn't any. Be my guest. Who was he Really. Nine Elms. It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you. 69. 80      CONTINUED 5                                                80 Woolwich Arsenal... Limehouse Chemical... Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms! Not us, you. This gives Holmes pause. Same to you. A brief nod, then Holmes is gone. A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up, moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices... Holmes' PISTOL. Not again. He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving look. Yes, I know. Don't give me that look, Gladstone. He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out. 8182                                                             8182 There must be fifty yards of mud out there. Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the prow. He whispers at Tanner. 74. 84   CONTINUED                                                   84 I know precisely how much money is in there. Oh, please. There was nothing honest about it. Come on, let's get this over with. 75. 86   CONTINUED                                                    86 Holmes.   You need to see this. 76. 89   CONTINUED                                                     89 90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE  FACTORY FLOOR                90 Oneeighteen.    It's a date, a time Holmes... A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM! The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights up all of London. What are you administering Are they subcutaneous, or deeper Get a mirror, I'll extract them myself. I haven't time for that.   My friend is in dire The best and wisest man I've ever known. morphine It was worth a wound, worth many wounds... Interesting artwork.   You look bloody awful. Took it out myself. Mary said I had a lousy doctor. Yes, oddly, it seems she might understand the power of partnership. 88. 98   CONTINUED                                                  98 It's half past nine. I brought you this... With your own venom no doubt. There's a new field in the treatment of abnormal personalities  it's called psychology. It appears you're what's considered a paraneurotic deviant with antisocial proclivities. Quite severe. And untreatable. At minimum. Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks. Man, Ox, Eagle... He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points of a cross. And last on the list    the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map... Parliament. It's right in the middle of the River Thames. BOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing. Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding the pub. How was Lestrade Well, your instructions were fairly precise... about everything except the window. Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself. What are we doing in the sewers You can tell that from here Will be dead at the strike of noon. 98. 110    CONTINUED 2                                               110 I'll keep these under wraps. 99. 112   CONTINUED                                                  112 Over there. Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away two dragging the pistolwhipped one, who is out. Watson turns so that he can watch the action at the device which puts his back to another tunnel. Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife, looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE You owe me for the ring. Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword  but only until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more uneven than usual. BONG! As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming. Hey! Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his belly, crawled from the sewer  where he found HOLMES' GUN. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's back aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the throughandthrough and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away, eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream. BONG! I'm pretty sure I heard the last chime. Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved. Which part The stench of the sewers or the broken bones My ankle's done. Watson looks around. Where's Irene Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again. Holmes, I'm sorry... Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device. One moment. Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes. Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room. Nothing really... Just a few scribbles... cases we've worked on over the years. I still can't believe he's given us that ring. Of course.    No question about it 123B   INT. 221 BAKER ST.                                          123B Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a horrific scene Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back to them. He looks dead. 114A. 123B   CONTINUED                                               123B Don't panic, dear. Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes. Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself. Watson pokes him.   Turns him around. Get on with it, Holmes. I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes. Watson and Mary walk by. How did you manage it, Holmes 115. 123B   CONTINUED 2                                            123B Worse things could happen. But none of this explains the lack of a pulse. He finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down. Holmes tumbles to the ground. His heart should be ticking in no time. 116. 123B   CONTINUED 3                                            123B Watson feels for a pulse in his dog's neck  he shakes his head. They are interrupted by a knock on the door. Constable Clark enters. Point blank range. Where is Blackwood's device now 116A. 123B   CONTINUED 4                                              123B So you're saying Moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison. Watson nods. Adler was just a diversion. Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his enthusiasm and interest. A KNOCK.   The Driver pokes his head in. Well... There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right. I'd wager there's a piece missing. Moriarty was after the machine not the poison. Holmes nods. Well... Take care of yourself, Holmes. Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary stops him.",5776,"[year, 1891, London, capital, world, height, modernity, hiss, steam, smell, coal, air, great, cesspool, sinners, criminals,

163,HOLMES,Sherlock Holmes,2008,False,"My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN takes a step into the road to watch him go and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, Victorianstyle. 2                                                                    2 INT. CARRIAGE  CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS  NIGHT inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry  a 19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE. A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A thinking man of action. 3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON  NIGHT                                   3 Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river. As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow. Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack. Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming. BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream. Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker knuckles to liver. BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating knucklepunch to the liver doubles up the bowlerhatted thug and crumples him to his knees. 4. 5   CONTINUED                                                       5 SECONDTIME ACTION  SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing. THWACK! Hammer blow to ear. CRACK! Karate chop to throat. WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver. BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground, Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move. Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase. POV  BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE Another bowlerhatted THUG approaches the bottom of the staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows. Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the crypts. 6                                                                    6 Watson.    Perfect timing. Just got it.    Where's Lestrade I don't know.    It's an old shirt. Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on. Right.    Shall we This is what they do.    This is what they like. No. Look. 8. 9A   CONTINUED 2                                                9A Look. Impeccable timing, Lestrade. We've gone for the doctor... And one for the rope. If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance. 9. 9A    CONTINUED 3                                              9A Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's still mouthing the incantation. Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them. Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to Holmes. Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. The double circle's for his own protection. Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar. Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket and A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera. FLASH! An explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops. The SCENE is FROZEN bright for a splitsecond and then it FADES. CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS, MUSIC AND TITLES OVER 10                                                                 10 Please... Watson, I've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot. Please... Don't, don't, don't... Gently, gently, Watson... 13. 14   CONTINUED                                                    14 I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better. He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging. There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. 14. 14   CONTINUED 2                                               14 I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister. Is it poisoned, nanny Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual. I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind. He'll be right as a trivet in no time. 15. 14   CONTINUED 3                                              14 There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all. Nothing. Absolutely. Wonderful. My favorite. Not available. Have you proposed yet Then it's not official. 16. 14   CONTINUED 4                                              14 Fashionably. My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced. Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson... ... see that walkingstick A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of hightensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler. I'd keep an eye on that, by the way. Yes, right behind you. He's cost us the rent more than once. Yes, I doubt You insist She insisted. You're a governess. Your student's a boy of 8. It's breathing. Then he's tall for his age. 18. 15   CONTINUED 4                                               15 He flicked ink at you today. There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly  which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess. However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more. 19. 15   CONTINUED 5                                               15 You were engaged. The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly. Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps. She's lovely. Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face. Their orders arrive  an array of plates piled high. The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat  then pauses, looks around. Well done.   Thank you. Holmes begins walking away. McMURDO Oi!   We ain't done here. Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable. 22. 15A17 CONTINUED 2                                             15A17 Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent. Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his hand. Hm.   Plymouth gin. He turns.   Steps back into the ring. The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee A little scartissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo braces for combat Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong. McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas. He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care. Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms. 18A                                                                   18A INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON  CORRIDOR  NIGHT A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A fullscale riot is on. Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners. The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who is frozen on the spot. I find that it lifts my spirits. Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale That's your job, not mine. Look at that structure. What has it been Five years' work already Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative. 26. 23   CONTINUED                                                    23 Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer. The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening. You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. So that's a no' to the opera then It's too small for you. Where are all the other prisoners I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to. Love what you've done with the place. A small point of concern. I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting. Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company. My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives. I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain  after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too. I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords. Bon voyage, Blackwood. Nothing. Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one. 29                                                                29 30. 29   CONTINUED                                                     29 Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down. But your signature is clear. Ah, the Maharajah's missing diamond. Another souvenir And you, husbands. No ring Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically 33. 30   CONTINUED 3                                              30 Who are you working for Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case. Allow me to explain. Thank you, I I don't believe You've had your fun. Now it's time to press on. Now it's time to press on. It doesn't matter Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my dates. Midget! No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people. No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not. Will you allow me to explain. Now, that's the Irene I know. He hurries after Irene down the alley. 38C                                                                  38C This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge. She's intimidated, scared... Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own. Clarky! What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard Watson, grab a compass. You means us. It is not my reputation at stake here. Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not. Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked. 38aA. 41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE  ESTABLISHING  DAY                 41 42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT  DAY                           42 Scotland Yard at their finest, once again. 39. 42   CONTINUED 2                                                42 And the coffin Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious... Inspector, may I see your pen All yours, Inspector. 42. 42     CONTINUED 5                                               42 Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt. Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner Now the game is afoot, Watson. 42A50 OMITTE                                                  42A50 51     EXT. LONDON STREET  DAY                                     51 Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper. Trust me. 42A. 51   CONTINUED                                                  51 indecipherable Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this. Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own. Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid. Excellent. The most recent is M.H... Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address. I think not. Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond. Do you have any changes It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.

Let me guess  you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man. You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth. indignant You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson We were set upon, man, it was self defense. Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face. You've never complained about my methods before. That was an accident... The first time WAS an accident... Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London. Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's in the interest of science. Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive. What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit. Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well. Invited Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home 54B. 67   CONTINUED 3                                               67 Lestrade  your usual impeccable timing.

Who's this As to where I am  I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit need I go on As to who you are  that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely. 56A. 72   CONTINUED                                                    72 Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. And as to the mystery  the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place. Yes.   They're almost interesting. Fear is the more infectious condition. In this case, fear of your own child. Blackwood is your son, yes You have the same colored irises  a rare dark green, with diamond shaped hazel flecks 58. 72   CONTINUED 3                                                 72 Thomas' ear plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either brothers, or, more likely, father and son. Evidently. One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you. I have one last question, Sir Thomas. If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive 73                                                              73 60. 74   EXT.

I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption. We're not. Tell me who you're working for and what he's after. I disagree. When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time. So what's it to be You're in over your head this time, Irene. 62. 75   CONTINUED 3                                                 75 How can you live like this always a fugitive.

He looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a spiritualist gathering. Faith runs riot over reason. Why did you drain the water Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse. Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it. Hmm... Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose. What is that Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own. Both cops hesitate  Holmes is not their boss. Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay! The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's eyeview, it may mean he looks down from a window sill. Sometimes he hums or sings to himself. Holmes is happy. He glances around the room, sees the chair where Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself. 65B. 78C   CONTINUED 2                                              78C His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust. The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

He steps toward An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar, four strange objects a strand of human HAIR, a cow's BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own. My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended. But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas. It is made up of four parts The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man 90A. 102   CONTINUED                                                 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face. In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map! Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying now. Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system. He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross... Then he picks up the charcoal and following the map draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor. Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here... He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew that has the hair 6 o'clock. Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here... Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone 12 o'clock. 90B. 102   CONTINUED 2                                              102 Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years  and not by coincidence. Holmes points to the map. The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here... He points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross. Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here. Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing. It is the fifth element  the ethereal. That which can't yet be known. 91. 102    CONTINUED 3                                              102 Ladies first. Irene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down. Follow these plans. Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room. Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade. 102A                                                               102A INT.

All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks. 106   INT. PARLIAMENT  LORD COWARD'S CHAMBERS                     106 The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by the sight of Holmes cuffed hands behind him and flanked by Lestrade and men. Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector. Lestrade punches Holmes. I'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented Very distinctive those handmade shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave. Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room. Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end. Nonetheless, I confess to being completely outmatched. I could deduce very little from my investigation. Coward turns away for a moment  Holmes subtly kicks a log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room with smoke. Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today Man, ox, eagle, lion  the lion is parliament, isn't it Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment. No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me. But your clothes say infinitely more than you ever hope. The mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking... A touch of red stock brick dust on your knee, from where you've been kneeling... Coward's knee dropping to the ground. A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing... Coward performing a ritual. A faint aroma of excrement, from where you have been standing. Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big ceremonial sword is prominent. You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago. 94A94B. 106   CONTINUED 3                                               106 Both Houses met today. The entire government will be present. Well there's no time to waste then, is there Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses. Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires another shot. With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window Coward opened. Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to 107                                                                107 EXT.

He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner. Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the rope. Irene is also present. When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat. Performed his role perfectly.   A little too perfectly, come to think of it. Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic. Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers. Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow. Watson, did you bring my clothes Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL. Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it. He's never going to like guns. 96. 107    CONTINUED 2                                              107 Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot. Trust me, have a drink. She can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson, Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers. Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you... As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward Big Ben, the time moving toward noon. 107A                                                               107A EXT.

A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE. Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise. No.   I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket    the RAT TAIL. I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Telltale signs of cyanide. He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it. That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas. As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.

He sees a shadow up in the Lords' Gallery. 111                                                                  111 Seven minutes to twelve... They nod. Shouldertoshoulder, they move down the tunnel, faster and faster. Irene trails them closely. Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt. It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise. They draw their guns. They burst into the area, completely surprising the three thugs. Watson pistolwhips the nearest.    Holmes frontkicks the next. The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee. I wouldn't. He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads straight for the device. Take this. Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson herds the three thugs away from the device. There's never been anything like it. A totally wirefree weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by humming, sparking coils. Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson. Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways, sending both guns spinning away Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer. Dredger spins Watson around, headbutts him with a teeth rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper cup. Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and Irene. 100. 112   CONTINUED 2                                              112 Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes crushes the other's larynx. Keep at it. Holmes goes for Dredger. 113   INT. PARLIAMENT  DAY                                       113 Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very emphatically. Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets. BONG!   The clock is ticking down. Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his knife, pouring the gunpowder into the bowl of his pipe. BONG! Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep. Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword from head to toe. Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword 102. 114    CONTINUED 2                                               114 which shatters against the floor. While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer with a splash, then turns back to the device. BONG! 114A   OMITTED                                                      114A 115    INT. HOUSE OF LORDS                                          115 Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked. Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of anyone going to open them. 116                                                                 116 INT. SEWER TUNNEL  DAY Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place. Shaped charge, Victorianstyle. We need a light, a match Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle   her KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve. Yes... it was. She looks past Holmes. Yes, we made it. Just. Watson rolls over, sits up.     He's done, had enough. Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this. Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact. Watson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness, face grim. 118A                                                                118A INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT  DAY Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official understory of the Houses, heads for a staircase spiralling even further down. 106. 118B   INT. SEWER TUNNELS  DAY                                   118B Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns, sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels and columns. She picks up speed. Why hurry off, give it a try. He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm. And in that split second Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls, Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge. But Irene doesn't pause She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and KICKS DOWN and IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE. There was never any magic.   Only conjuring tricks. Above Holmes   the raven starts PECKING at a rope. The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard... Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS. payoff Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. licking rocks Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe  a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. flashback Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained. 110B. 119H   CONTINUED 4                                           119H That might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. pulling the trigger wharf explosion The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid  yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. ceremony, dev ice Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote  at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power. END FLASHBACKS. 111. 119H   CONTINUED 5                                            119H Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind whips harder. Holmes doesn't notice The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G. a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to topple. faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that Holmes played earlier for his flies. You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them. IN B.G. We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane... You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly. Holmes looks around at the gathering storm. Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at breakneck speed. Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope. Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt. The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down, Blackwood is on his knees, cowed. 112. 119H   CONTINUED 6                                              119H First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang... properly this time. Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes through the floorboards Blackwood smirks. We'll see about that shall we. BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away. Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther... and finally SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly. Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet. Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a cloud. His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things that cannot be explained. Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He takes her hand. Oh, Irene... His fingers move to take her pulse. 112A. 119H   CONTINUED 7                                             119H Her eyes pop open. Irene makes a quick move she tries to CUFF him.   But this time, Holmes is ready for it He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a seat next to her. They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking out over the Thames. We've still got a moment. A bit of a smile and break. Sadly, yes. Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword stick, keeps walking. At the end of the top of the stairs.    Holmes hands the Cylinder to one of the policemen. 120122 OMITTED                                                   120122 122A   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE  DUSK                                     122A Rain falls softly. Thank you, Lestrade. She won't be by the time your boys get there. Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees... 113A. 122A   CONTINUED                                                122A A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson, no words spoken. Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it. The two of them stand looking out down the Thames. 114. 123    EXT. 221 BAKER ST.  DAYS LATER                                 123 MOVING DAY. Mary and Watson walk towards 221B. A DRIVER loads Watson's boxes into a CARRIAGE that waits in front of the apartment. Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook  I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down. The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all. There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and welltrained as your own. It is known locally as mad honey disease. He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind. What is it this time, Clarky Were there powder burns on his eyebrows Clarky nods. With small caliber bullet. Moriarty. Holmes and Watson look at each other  complete change of demeanor  mind racing, looking concerned. The dog has regained its vital signs. I'd wager there's a piece missing. Constable Clarke nods.   Holmes pulls his coat on. The wirefree invention was the game all along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves. I'll leave with you.   Clarky, case reopened. 124                                                                 124 Were there powder burns on his eyebrows Clarky nods. Where is Blackwood's device now Wager, Watson... I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however. Blackwood's wirefree invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two... Irene was just a diversion. Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his enthusiasm and interest. A KNOCK.   The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in. I'll walk out with you... 118. 127   EXT. 221 BAKER ST.  DAY                                      127 Mary and Gladstone wait for Watson in the carriage. Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat. Holmes extends an awkward hand. An honor working with you, Doctor. Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.      A warm look, an understanding between the two men. Magnificent woman, Watson. Magnificent! They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street  perhaps the POV of the raven.

165,MARY,Sherlock Holmes,2008,False,"The pleasure's mine. It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes. 16A. 15   CONTINUED                                                 15 I've a whole stack of detective novels at home. Poe, Wilkie Collins... They can seem a bit farfetched sometimes, though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details. I intend to. With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know him. But what about a perfect stranger What can you tell about me No, it'd be wonderful.   I insist. Well done. Charlie's 7, actually. Is there ink on my face Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died. 20. 15     CONTINUED 6                                               15 Excuse me Do you really     Doctor. You have nothing more to say to me Is that the best you can do I'm disappointed, but not surprised. If anything happens to him, both our lives are lost.

We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a splash of white in the shadows  the Doctor from the hospital is slumped down against the wall. We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the Doctor is actually Holmes. There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down, obscuring him but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified. 94B94E OMITTED                                                 94B94E 95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB  ATTIC                                   95 Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling. He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings bone, hair, feather, fang from Sir Thomas' house. Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him at 12 o'clock. The eagle feather to his right at 3 o'clock. The human hair behind him at 6 o'clock and the Lion's fang to his left at 9 o'clock. Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. In the center circle he draws a pentagram using wax from a burning candle. Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. He lights four candles one at each point of the cross then stands in the center of the circle. He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle. 85A. 95   CONTINUED                                                    95 What's in all those notebooks All your adventures... I'd love to read them sometime. Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this idea before they enter. 123A                                                               123A INT. 221 BAKER ST.  STAIRCASE As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger. Holmes had it made into an engagement ring. Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving Shouldn't you help him, John John. Watson draws his sword. What's wrong with Gladstone There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right. Try not to be too late for dinner with my parents and... be careful. She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.

CORRIDOR                               36A He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other end of the corridor.

I'll return them, shall I She takes both wallets, takes the roses These are lovely, thank you. and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on the floor. On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too, then leaves. If you're going to watch me take my clothes off, Sherlock, the least you can do is help me with the buttons. To watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense, Sherlock, and could get you into a lot of trouble... So why don't you come over here and help me instead. That's better. I knew I could count on you. 61. 75   CONTINUED                                                     75 Wonderful. Case closed then. Your services are no longer required.

This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock  one in shackles, the other with the key. I've NEVER been in over my head. But free. And on my own terms. Just like you  well, not you at this exact moment 63. 75    CONTINUED 4                                               75 She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there. but generally speaking. Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway. If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have time to check out. I hope you don't mind settling the bill. OR ALT What were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something you'll have to explain for yourself.

Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her. The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the next blast. Watson sees a LEVER PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP! that looks promising, turns to head for it  then his eyes focus on a big canvas splatter cloth. Well, I'm a captive audience. Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to Holmes who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the flames hit them. The heat is excruciating  but the cloth protects them. Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it  just. Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until Oh Shit! he looks ahead sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a long, conveyorbeltwide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER. Decision time for Watson  help Holmes and Irene, or try the lever He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it all the way over and the belt speeds up with a jerk. Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the original speed, looks around for another possible off switch. Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off the belt still opposite side to Watson, grabs Irene's legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged into the boiling water. 79. 90A   CONTINUED 2                                              90A She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes moving sideways, keeping pace with her. to show the strain You had a question. Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past various obstacles In some countries steam is considered excellent therapy for the skin. then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt, jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS. Watson hears the scream, turns  then sees something again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine. When Holmes has Irene stable again I have to say  it's overrated. Holmes has to admire her courage  until he hears Watson yelling at him. Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor belt. Watson points at the Ibeam running above them.   Holmes nods. Irene sees it, too. Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended upside down by her shackles and her feet and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water. Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She swings off the Ibeam, through the air 80. 90A   CONTINUED 3                                              90A and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water. As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP! Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch. Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the equipment, following her. Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes them. Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt, catches up to Irene just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW. Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled. Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH. Whew! Watson looks at them with relief  close one  and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK! A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw. Shit a brick. Sherlock Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might smashes the shackle lock. Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her right hand. The bandsaw whines viciously. Irene swings aside, just misses it. 80A. 90A   CONTINUED 4                                             90A Gets a free haircut. Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she can free her right hand a move not possible with both shackles. Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME. Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut inhalf pig carcasses. They're okay. Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door, looking for Blackwood. Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile Thank you so much. I owe you. pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes grabs her, stops her. Blackwood's manufactured large scale weapons for years. Lately there've been rumors of something new. More powerful than anything else. And... magical. My job is to find out if the rumors are true. 81. 90A   CONTINUED 5                                                 90A I would say they are. And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails her, processing. They blast through the doors to 91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91 Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock. He sees Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into the darkness. Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson. Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something on the planks Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes it. I was... I had to get you to pass out to settle down. Oh, I poisoned that one. Better a snake than a lap dog. No, doctor, I'm simply a woman. 89A. 99    CONTINUED                                                  99 Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage. ALTERNATE DIALOGUE Not quite, doctor. Let me make it simple for you, with a lot fewer words  I'm what's called a woman. Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage. 100   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB  ATTIC  ON HOLMES                     100 as he plays the violin, but not with a bow. He plucks it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor. Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's observed over the course of the investigation. He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor. Then he moves to the ox bone  a flash of Sir Thomas' ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal. Next to the ox bone Holmes writes  Sir Thomas  OX ring. Next, he moves to the feather  a flash to an Eagle in flight  he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an American flag, then to Standish with his eagletopped cane. Next to the feather he writes America. Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man. Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion he thinks  BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big question mark. Where Who Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang as if willing the flashes to come. 101                                                               101 Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty. What is the meaning of this circle Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn  the point at which the other four come together. They look to where it would correspond to on the map  right in the middle of the river. Police. Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson. He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it open. Where to, Sherlock Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment. Starting early, aren't we He offers the flask to her. All of the people inside that building I've never seen anything like it. Nine strokes left. Dredger grins until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung with full force by Watson. Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding ears. Holmes heads back to Irene. Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly enough, but not very big. Got it... Which is when a bloodmaddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice. That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because BONG! of her Three. 103. 116    CONTINUED                                                  116 ON THE DEVICE AS IT GOES ACTIVE The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears ratchet past each other. Bad news. Two! Holmes and Irene stagger for the device. Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a tree. Watson is facedown on the stones, still.   The gun falls out of his limp hand. Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade, and... ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade, redirecting the spark toward Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The shaped charge shears the steel rods. Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders. BONG! 116A                                                               116A That was something new for us. Watson 105. 118    CONTINUED                                                   118 Holmes whips around  sees Watson, seemingly dead. He goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for a pulse. With his face still pressed to the stones Goodbye! He start to move towards her.     She whips out her gun. You of all people know I will pull this trigger. They circle around each other. 109. 119H   CONTINUED                                                 119H I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I wish things could be different but you wouldn't believe me anyway. It looks like rain. You were right, he is a professor. Moriarty. Key's in the watch pocket. 113. 119H   CONTINUED 8                                               119H Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close, near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her shirt just as she dropped them down his pants. He snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and walks away. She smiles, calls out You'll miss me, Sherlock.",3977,"[London, bleak, time, year, 31, 30, CONTINUED, 30, pining, New, Jersey, prefer, travel, winter, brought, souvenirs, Dates, Jordan, tea, Ceylon,
