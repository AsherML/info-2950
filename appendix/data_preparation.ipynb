    "While the above code works for most script formats, occassionally formatting errors in the script itself can result in errors. Additionally often the same character will be referred to by different names in a script. For example, in a single movie dialogue spoken by the character Harry Wilkens might be labelled as Harry, Mr. Wilkens, Harry's Voice, or any other permutations. Additionally, while the original researchers claimed to have removed setting description and camera directions from the scripts, they did not do so entirely. These often appear in the same format in the script as calls for new characters, causing countless errors. These two convenience functions below serve to elimniate these errors. The first deals with the issue of character permutations, allowing us to combine all the dialogue said by two characters and then deleting the extras from the list. The second is more simple, and is used to flat-out remove entries that were not characters but were added in error."
