    "Our initial data came from a corpus compiled by researchers at UC Santa Cruz center for Natural Language and Dialogue Systems entitled (appropriately enough) Film Corpus 2.0. Here’s the full citation: (Marilyn A. Walker, Grace I. Lin, Jennifer E. Sawyer. \"An Annotated Corpus of Film Dialogue for Learning and Characterizing Character Style.\" In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Istanbul, Turkey, 2012). The corpus was originally designed to serve as a general purpose dataset for researchers interested in natural language problems involving dialogue and conversation. This corpus consisted of 862 film scripts downloaded from the internet movie scripts database (imsdb.com) separated by the genre they were labeled as. Ostensibly, there was minimum cleaning performed on the datasets to isolate dialogue, but this cleaning process wasn’t particularly consistent as some scripts included scene descriptions, camera instructions such as “CUT TO” or “FADE TO”, blocking, or non-spoken character actions.

This dataset associates words with a binary score of 1 or 0 if they are correlated with any of the listed emotions or sentiments (anger, anticipation, fear, disgust, joy, negativity, positivity, sadness, surprise, trust). This dataset was compiled through crowdsourcing, where researchers asked participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk whether they thought a given word should be linked to these emotions."

    "Some things that may have influenced the data could be the process by which we selected the movies and the characters. While neither were chosen arbitrarily, but based on a set of criteria, these decisions still had the potential to affect our larger analysis. For example, we chose movies based on a common set of criteria, thereby attempting to avoid any and all influence on our data in that regard, but it is still possible we added a movie falsely or skipped a movie we should have included. Alternatively, although we included what we viewed to be the most prominent characters, that may not hold true in the eyes of others, and could ultimately hurt our analyses in that regard as well. "

There could be a selection bias here where only scripts that were easily accessible in the public domain or movies that were highly popular had their scripts added to the database. We viewed this as an acceptable risk given that high performing movies were likely to either trendsetters in the mystery movie genre (thus causing other movies to emulate them) or at the very least following the lead of other successful movies. Therefore, we view these scripts as descriptive of the mystery movie genre at large, even if they’re not necessarily a near-exhaustive sample. \n"

This was calculated by adding together the scores for each word’s emotion as stated in our emotion lexicon and then dividing by the total number of words spoken by that character.\n",

    "After the initial data was collected, we removed and corrected errors in the processing of the scripts. There were two main types of errors. The first was that the program would pick up scene descriptions or narration which used a characters name. We removed these from the dataset since they don't actually describe what the character says, merely how they're being shown by the camera. The second type of error was when the same character is referred to in multiple ways. One example was when lines spoken by the character Lee Blanchard in Black Dahlia were attributed to either \"Lee Blanchard\", \"Lee\", or \"Lee's voice\". We corrected these errors by amalgamating all lines into the most informative character name (in this case Lee Blanchard) and then removing the duplicated. All in all 51 such entries were removed combined according to these metrics"

    "Our data set was a compilation of hand-selected movies that fit the archetypal mystery movie stereotype, with a villain to be found. We ended up with approximately 50 scripts to pull from, which means that the patterns we are seeing in villains only are based off of these 50 movies over time. This could be a representation concern if we were to be using this data to be representative of all films, but given that we are only discussing that one subset of mystery movies, This limiting aspect of our data should also be okay. The results we get could be vaguely generalizing for people who watch this particular sub genre of film, but if they are wary of our sample size then hopefully it should be alright. \n",
    "We are not analyzing the villains speech pattern off of every character in the movie, but off of five main characters who are not villains. This weakness was addressed while creating our data set and hopefully accounted for in final calculations. \n",
    "The data collected also is very variable depending on the film, in some films, the five main characters have a consistent number of lines and amount of interactions, but for others that is not the case. This skew could make it seem as though villains have a similar tone to regular characters in one movie, when in reality, the characters all have similar tones because they all live in the same town and have experienced similar things. \n"
